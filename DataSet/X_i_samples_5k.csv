"usually , he would be"
mason barely acknowledged
"instead , his baby blues remained"
since the movie was
each time she looked
his platinum blond hair and blue eyes were
where megan was
"after that , he had"
"with his professional football career on the rise , davis had"
"instead , he wanted"
she never wanted
"with a sigh , she stepped"
she  would always loved
while it boasted
when she was
when it came
"instead , she called"
as she stepped
when he started
one day when they had
when they made
she only had
"with a smirk , sean replied"
once he was
her parents rattled
even though she  would been
"instead , she had"
"at that time , she had"
"instead , it was"
"with her grades already in the toilet , she was"
by the time she got
"of course , her relationship with davis ended"
one thing her mother prided
as they started
while it was
after megan watched
"at the last door on the right , she knocked"
as noah sucked
both father and son were
"with a nod , emma replied"
especially since his gown is
noah momentarily stopped
i plan on spoiling
"i mean , the man is"
this man was
widowers usually fell
she certainly hoped
"more than anything , she wanted"
"with a shrug , megan replied"
when casey snorted
as casey got
thank you so very much for bringing
so it was
a smile spread across her face as noah kicked
"i mean , whatever was"
and he certainly did
"with a wicked grin , casey added"
"besides the physical part , he is"
maybe it could give
if he was
especially if the last woman he cared
although megan had
maybe in a few years but right now she just wanted
she  would willingly sacrificed
"after all , he was"
"with a laugh , megan said"
just as megan opened
the natives are
"with a laugh , aidan announced"
he then leaned
megan and casey followed
"in a panic , she demanded"
her father smiled
what she was
all her relatives were
"without hesitation , her eyes scanned"
"even beneath the lines of the clothing , she could make"
"his wavy , jet-black hair was"
chapter three pesh paced
the fact he was
although emma had
the last time they  would been
but that was
the euphoria of the moment now had
a side door opened
when his lips curved
i never could have
so when it comes
it would have
as he craned
"noah , however , did"
his tiny brows wrinkled
"with a reluctant nod , pesh replied"
when the tiny blonde turned
everything about her from her sparkling
"finally , she took"
while she possessed
"to them , he was"
the way it framed
"sure , it was"
and while originally he had
a small voice cried
"not to mention , she seemed"
mason reluctantly went
after angie walked
once it was
a priest in decorated golden robes appeared
before they went
when they reached
aidan and emma made
when megan elbowed
after he finished
then it came
the priest took
once the baptism part was
just as pesh sighed
as the photographer pushed
"for the first time , he noticed"
he could also make
"of course , it does"
"reluctantly , pesh stepped"
as the flashes went
as she focused
"by now , noah was"
the baby instantly stopped
pesh quickly plastered
after several flashes went
both noah and pesh sighed
he merely winked
chapter four when megan arrived
the tables were
a low whistle behind her got
as emma breezed
with me not working
"and with my connections , i was"
while casey started
"with a scowl , emma mumbled"
"even with everyone around , it was"
just as her chest started
i  will keep
"whatever , papa , `` she murmured"
he  would ditched
"with the first button of his shirt undone , she could see"
maybe because you did
"those words and pesh will never , ever go"
as aidan chuckled
"of course , i do"
as emma walked
because you never know
"and with a wink , he walked"
as the sunlight started
by the time it was
the truth was
somehow they managed
"no , i did"
my father would have
"as the oldest , i always looked"
my mother has
"originally , i wanted"
"after a resigned sigh , he finally asked"
a man does
when pesh took
in a soft voice that vibrated
as she shifted
he quickly released
her chin trembled
i experience it every time i see
"by his raised eyebrows , pesh seemed"
after she gave
as megan listened
she  would never had
all of us have
the intensity of his gaze caused
i may be
"grinning , aidan turned"
after aidan headed
"at the moment , she was"
the corners of his lips turned
"damn , he was"
twelve years to be
her fingers itched
"okay , `` she said"
when they changed
then when she became
her life moved
the conversation and laughter flowed
a flush filled
as aidan came
the room was
"oh god , she was"
she  would barely consumed
now she  would had
a gentle hand landed
as she rose
thanks for me asking
"god , this was"
as she staggered
i  will take
i  will make
"always the gentleman , pesh opened"
once he made
"wait , was"
wan na be
alcohol always had
the motion caused
"with a snort , she replied"
"i mean , we were"
"course , she did"
"hell , i got"
like my panties got
how you still get
"instead , she closed"
when the car started
as they pulled
after he came
her wobbly legs wavered
with the alcohol fueling
her blurry vision took
she just wanted
"even in the semi-darkness , she could see"
the brief connection made
as she started
as his tongue once again invaded
his chest heaved
"a beautiful , sexy blonde writhed"
her heat and her arousal scorched
while his conscious railed
her fingers raked
his body was
but his once hazy mind was
he could not and would not take
he  would never taken
although the devil on his shoulder raged
i  will have
she rapidly blinked
her eyes widened
when she wavered
"moaning , she covered"
"come , let"
"with a weak nod , she replied"
"with his free hand , he took"
i hate to see
"her broken expression , coupled"
the corners of her lips curved
when he got
"with a defeated expression , she dropped"
he then reached
"his lips on her skin , his tongue licking"
he momentarily faltered
just as he was
when it opened
thank you again for the clothes and for letting
"after all , the last thing he needed"
it would be
i just do
when she nodded
although his brain was
"instead , he stripped"
although he probably should have
"megan lay on her side in the bed , her face turned"
her eyes were
"without a word to her , he walked"
his other hand rested
somehow he wanted
the corners of her mouth momentarily turned
"thankfully , she did"
"and within a few minutes , her labored breathing signaled"
"for the first time in two years , he fell"
chapter six sunlight streamed
but the tranquility of her morning was
what kind of mother was
as she tried
her gaze flicked
who the hell did
a whimper escaped
"oh god , had"
never in her life had
"and with that realization , everything from the night before came"
overcome with the emotions threatening
once she closed
once she finished
"without a hairbrush or comb , she did"
once she surmised
"in silence , they made"
it certainly was
she  would made
when she replied
i just wanted
"just sex , `` she answered"
if the situation had
"finally , when she gathered"
"without another word , he opened"
"always the gentleman , he waited"
"once again , he appeared"
when he pulled
but she had
as she made
the car remained
his question and concern caused
although his expression was
her clinical placement had
a tall blonde woman in her fifties came
that way you  will be
"with a smile , kristi led"
each time they passed
but we  are
surely there were
the moment he turned
the shock and surprise registered
the last thing she needed
as she gazed
the night i was
"the girl , or woman , who would do"
"for me , it was"
i would give
"with a shake of her head , she replied"
we  will always be
"for some reason , his words had"
"finally , she managed"
"with a smile , he then turned"
a nervous giggle escaped
"lord , if i was"
"unfortunately , she was"
chapter eight as pesh exited
we usually have
"nervously , he scratched"
"in the two months since their first encounter , he had"
now that she had
"finally , it rushed"
the teasing faded
most likely she had
her anxious tone was
as he flashed
while pesh quickly turned
your pupils are
as soon as the door closed
if you know
a red flush entered
as pesh crossed
"i mean , who is"
so stop beating yourself up over what you  are
"at the mention of a third child , aidan swallowed"
but just to be
pesh almost laughed
"with a regretful shake of his head , pesh replied"
i may have
maybe if you- `` although it was
not deeply where her needs were
"hell , she was"
when aidan started
when pesh opened
an orderly appeared
but after talking
the moment they finished
when she pushed
what- `` before she could even get
"question , the man started"
"instead , he gazed"
i demand to see
when it appeared
when he did
the first time she had
"god , `` she murmured"
mr. robertson swallowed
his blue eyes widened
i  will be
when she whirled
his brows knitted
the last thing she was
although it was
as unsteady as you are
as pesh led
mr. robertson glanced
"with a sheepish expression , he replied"
"at the word , color flooded"
his reaction was
"but of course , their past interactions made"
when mr. robertson started
when mr. robertson shrugged
megan bit down on her lip to keep
once pesh finished
that should reduce
"with a gulp , mr. robertson replied"
she gladly retreated
"once pesh finished , he dropped"
mr. robertson questioned
mr. robertson paled
"every few minutes , he was"
each time he grimaced
when the needle pierced
"finally , when the last of the blood had"
i would also do
"besides , you  are"
a teasing twinkle flashed
the cafeteria is
if someone came
after they stepped
as they surmised
after the food service worker gave
as he took
while the bottom half was
she  would just finished
the twinkle returned
a shiver went
his brows rose
a mixture of emotions coursed
"one of the residents , a young male named"
the best groin swelling
when megan wrinkled
"surprisingly , pesh did"
his smiles were
with the chaos surrounding
chapter ten after two exhausting
so she was
"an hour after the call , she was"
"with his eyes widening , he quickly replied"
"with a pained expression , aidan groaned"
she  will undoubtedly have
when he winked
"but deep down , it was"
"love , companionship , and devotion within marriage while having"
if you were
"but no , you have"
as megan buckled
"besides , casey is"
"before long , they were"
then they walked
a round of hugs was
once they eased
"with a nod , casey replied"
that statement made
i just know
with her dark eyes widening
after the waitress appeared
and you  are
as megan raised
maybe a b * * w j * b while wearing
"hmm , that was"
then he can take
"thankfully , the food arrived"
as the adrenaline began
"on it , a young woman was"
the paramedics had
because her labor was
"instead , they  would wheeled"
it really was
each one was
the woman glanced
they will be
her heavily painted
"well , making"
although he had
a gasp of shock behind him caused
of all the people in the world that could have
"glancing over her shoulder at kara , megan said"
"with a grimace , he said"
as much as he hated
when i am
his smile started
"with a resigned sigh , he made"
a voice across the room shouted
without even looking
few people in his life addressed
"slowly , he rose"
"his youngest brother , dev , stalked"
"as the oldest of his three siblings , he had"
mia martinelli had
"in her heartbreak , mia had"
"truthfully , he had"
when i tried
before dev could do
"word to the wise , sweetheart , do"
a deep growl erupted
the impact did
even as she flailed
his hand came
"resignedly , he followed"
as she busied
at what must have
her laughter warmed
she obviously really cared
but then there was
"of course , that was"
as he allowed
his feelings gave
at the look that flashed
his heartbeat thrummed
part of him wanted
she quickly deposited
"with a squeal , megan said"
"with a smile , pesh said"
"in his world , women were"
even though jade was
"but megan , she was"
his mind went
his pager went
as his hand hovered
"but finally , he just said"
chapter twelve days melted
"patients , both young and old , adored"
"immediately , her entire body switched"
the woman gave
as megan surveyed
the needle slipped
some of it was
"trading places with pesh , she started"
a screech came
"without hesitation , pesh replied"
as megan helped
her head lolled
a patient was
what the hell were
the elevator doors opened
when one doctor stepped
as one of the nurses scrambled
once the cart arrived
after he removed
"slowly , he eased"
a nurse took
"nadeen , you go"
pesh slung away from the surgeon and started
as the doors closed
somehow he had
"at the thought of pesh 's grief , megan 's chest tightened"
although none of us would say
of course pesh would do
"without hesitation , megan swiped"
"cautiously , her hand hovered"
a breeze rippled
"finally , megan took"
his usually warm eyes took
the clouds above them opened
then it is
when death comes
so we were
once the iui process did
a ragged sigh came
although we were
although mason was
although her aunt was
still without answers as to how jade had
the weight of his pain was
one minute she was
when he finally turned
his head bowed
the rain began
her eyelids fluttered
his mouth hovered
"silently , she pleaded"
now her senses were
his lips were
his tongue danced
drops of rain pelted
her eyes opened
his expression turned
"torn , megan did"
as she pounded
i can do
as megan turned
one minute he  would been
her finger came
as memories of his kisses filled
"in the end , she had"
chapter thirteen pesh regretfully watched
the woman had
"regardless of the flirting and easy banter between them , he had"
one voice argued
"in the end , he  would made"
"with a frustrated grunt , he realized"
when he spotted
when he closed
now that he was
her response was
his words were
that i still do
his brows furrowed
although his heart wanted
half of the women in the hospital would be
but now it seemed
"for a brief moment , pesh thought by her hesitation that she had"
she may have
you would let
the kiss was
"as his tongue thrust into her mouth , his hand came"
"unsatisfied with the lack of contact , he pulled"
"over her bra , he kneaded"
"reluctantly , he pulled"
"with his hands on her shoulders , he steered"
instead of his hands going
her legs wrapped
once he had
one of her hands abandoned
give and take
"through the thin scrap of her thong , his hand caressed"
"god , yes , i do"
as his fingers sped
"instead , he focused"
"her pink , glistening"
as his tongue flicked
his lips closed
her h * ps began
when he finally glanced
his hands gently came
a shudder rippled
and then all hell had
he  would decided
"with a coy smile , she scooted"
his h * ps bucked
when his erection was
her breath scorched
her words were
"the dirty talk , coupled"
since he  would never had
when he returned
i always keep
his heartbeat sped
already the wheels had
since it might be
we might be
"at the sound of his pager , he grimaced"
"without hesitating , he bowed"
her breath warmed
she  would changed
while she  would pulled
after the fragrant cloud faded
"without another word to her brothers , she went"
when her dad looked
"the doorbell rang , and she was"
her heart did
as he nodded
she  would just reached
pesh and i are
then he smiled
as mason raced
we can go
"after several tense moments , he was"
it only seems
you better eat yours before i do
then the two of them went
some guys would have
when the last ticket was
his reply seemed
while the gesture was
"instead , she just enjoyed"
"of course , i seriously doubt we  are"
an amused look twinkled
"still in shock , she remained"
"after all , if tantric sex with pesh was"
everything ready to go
"thanks , `` lewis replied"
his dark eyes narrowed
"with his expression softening , he closed"
and if it takes
as he walked
the propeller on the front of the plane started
suddenly the sound of the tower came
the plane lurched
just like when she was
she never was
the flight took
"with a wink , he added"
the runway got
the plane started
"after a quick talk with a member of the grounds crew , pesh took"
a cab waited
when they began
the cab stopped
"trust me , as hungry as i am"
the waiter returned
now it was
when the waiter appeared
"then one day , there she was"
somehow i just connected
i  would been
if i did
i also have
although he was
"with a rueful smile , she added"
their main course arrived
because he was
but he never made
he always seemed
sexual acts are
she  would slow
the band finished
a lone piano pounded
megan immediately recognized
the electricity between them shifted
her gaze dropped
his tongue pulled
it both overwhelmed and inflamed
as they neared
once he retrieved
as she sized
he quickly finished
when megan dared
a growl came
the elevator dinged
if you do
"without another word , his fingers went"
the heat of his gaze stoked
the way he said
after she loosened
"deftly , her fingers worked"
as he shrugged
"at the feel of his breath against her lips , she inhaled"
even if she had
when she exhaled
two fingers entered
when pesh curled
her orgasm rocketed
then he was
just as his head nudged
"in the heat of the moment , she had"
neither one of us has
"in her mind , she began"
this time they both moaned
the pace was
the entire time he moved
his gaze was
the longer she stared
the old saying was
and that scared
while their connection at first had
he quickly flipped
when he reentered
"with each thrust , he went"
her fingers fisted
once her walls finished
as he groaned
i could say
besides the amazing physical chemistry they shared
"in that instance , the sex had"
"but with pesh , the sex had"
although she should have
once he decided
as his magic hands massaged
his hands stilled
i just wondered
his face came
his hand skimmed
as her nipple hardened
then he flicked
slowly he started
each time she moved
"with his knee , he nudged"
when she finally stopped
she teasingly pinched
as she stroked
when his chest began
her tongue flicked
when she released
then she once again slid him in her mouth and began
his groans began
his grip on her hair tightened
as he fell
although they were
as pesh handed
his mouth opened
"when he finally , recovered"
when he stopped
you just got
regardless of how tempting
and despite being
"sex , that was"
once they got
she only opened
"in the day , everything is"
"but in the dark , you have"
"with a shrug , she replied"
from the moment they had
"of course , she really was"
"and now , just two weeks after their first date in savannah , they were"
"although , the first day back at work proved"
but the fact was
as much as megan tried
"of course , he was"
like on monday when he had
the gentleman she had
"but besides the naughty sexcapade , he  would wanted"
and to make
the fact that pesh was
when they talked
a shudder went
at that moment if there was
once they were
when we  are
his body tensed
megan vaguely remembered
"with her thumb , she pressed"
with her fingers grasping
that will give
suddenly she was
"god , he really and truly believed"
"instead , she braced"
"without thinking , megan stomped"
you just landed
but when you have
with the adrenaline depleting
or maybe the more appropriate word was
greedily her mouth devoured
when she rose
"with a nod , she began"
"condom , `` he murmured"
somehow without being
"with one quick thrust , he was"
"instead , the sounds in the air were"
with her walls milking
as he went
it probably did
"after a few heated moments , pesh pulled"
"instead of pesh before her , it was"
those words caused
"instead , she merely patted"
"finally , she just gave"
chapter seventeen when pesh arrived
both disappointment and concern filled
as much as pesh hated
when his shift ended
poor thing offered
nothing good can come
after he dialed
the call went
one of her younger brothers answered
if you go
"at the side door , he knocked"
kristi and i were
her expression softened
will you let
sometimes it can give
while he appreciated
she then motioned
her words reminded
"no matter what the situation , she was"
a funny look passed
once the bedroom door closed
the sound of a fork clattering
instead of arguing
"instead , he just embraced"
"of course , as much as she tried"
"with a frustrated groan , she shifted"
no man had
after she toweled
the sight across from her on the couch made
with the strains of despicable me playing
"in that moment , she allowed"
"in those minutes of weakness , she wondered"
"besides her own happiness , there was"
"on shaky legs , she walked"
when his eyelids fluttered
his gaze spun around the room like he was
"besides , i took"
when he whimpered
"against his lips , she murmured"
a wicked gleam flashed
as they lapsed
"without another word , she rose"
"in her heart , she was"
but for how everything between them had
"most often , he came"
although her parents did
what they did
since they had
but somehow they made
"in the end , the pent up emotions that were"
the last three times she had
pesh never seemed
since the day she  would seen
"instead , she crossed"
i can see
"whatever , `` megan replied"
"but at the moment , it was"
"after a casual shrug of her shoulders , kara replied"
but more than not wanting
the garage door leading
when i went
but i do
as he stirred
a long sigh escaped
so after having
i never imagined
"i mean , the very fact i agreed"
if she was
anyone who has
then he poured
this time he took
his fingers trailed
as she whined
he only got
then his fingers went
you will never allow
his teeth grazed
once she recovered
as his mouth latched
each time he went
as she pinched
her movements caused
i never have
when her blazing blue eyes were
when she decided
after he took
each time she took
when she lowered
"immediately , she started"
a bite of vegetables had
a forkful of rice had
"then in a flash , she tackled"
"at the sight of smeared vegetables and rice on the sheet next to him , he began"
his chest shook so hard that he wanted
as their tongues battled
although her body trembled
then he took
and then she came
the sight of her was
i like the fact you  are
her hands feathered
as she squeezed
all of my family will be
with her head buried
what if their dislike caused
"at the same time , it was"
while he said
when he joined
"after all , i could be"
"in a low voice , she said"
when her hands started
as the supervising
she slowly nodded
as she hurried
he never used
"at the feel of a hand on his back , he whirled"
"at his blatant lie , megan covered"
his phone dinged
but he supposed
"his parents , along with at least one of his brothers , would be"
her diminutive figure wobbled
your family is
it might not be
i even watched
i kind of hated
if he did
our situations are
i honestly do
"like always , he opened"
then she fiddled
"his brother-in-law , sanjay , cried"
after he hugged
"with a self-assured tone , he added"
as sanjay turned
"quickly , she stepped"
as they came
"his sister , shveta , came"
his mother and father exchanged
although public displays of affection between men and women were
the room then fell
his mother cleared
since it was
"with a snort , sanjay replied"
his mother demanded
"yes , i took"
a nervous laugh erupted
as they made
without the others catching
as the dishes began
once the plates had
as his mother turned
but i did
when he quickly pushed
"across the table from them , shveta cleared"
we would have
"of course , after you see"
as the table laughed
his patience is
at the sight of megan sitting
and before you can make
"with a tsk , charlie replied"
"in true dev fashion , he rolled"
but dev was
from the way her shoulders were
"just like at his parents , the women were"
as soon as becky came
pesh hung back as the others started
regardless of how welcoming
"with a grimace , aidan said"
pesh obediently bowed
when patrick finished
when aidan gave
after everyone finished
both mason and noah wanted
their conversation was
as the others laughed
never in a million years could he have
conversation in the dining room silenced
a strangled cry caused
wide-eyed and open mouthed
"then without another word , she bolted"
pesh sat in a shocked silence for a few seconds trying
"bending over , he whispered"
when mason nodded
after he raced
with her elbows braced
but what- `` she silenced
her question caused
he also questioned
i should be
one minute you  are
while that would be
if you give
as their lips moved
when she flicked
when megan pushed
usually the consummating comes
"at the sound of the door opening , pesh tried"
megan quickly scrambled
i just came
"next time , i  will make"
if it were
but i will say
"in the end , you have"
he then turned
"in the absence of champagne , wine was"
may you see
may you know
the others raised
once pesh tasted
"chapter twenty-one standing in front of the lighted hotel mirror , megan surmised"
"without her input , the plaza ballroom of the ritz carlton in atlanta had"
what she had
the top part was
while the front part appeared
"the skirt , with its beaded waistband , started"
the long strands were
a gorgeous purple orchid adorned
all that was
"apparently , it was"
although the necklace and earrings were
they both had
but when you came
her heart stopped
"basically , it was"
but his top was
her shaky hands reached
she quickly worked
she just tried
once everyone was
on the table in front of them were
the wreaths crisscrossed
it all seemed
she quickly followed
a song she had
his expression grew
the song ended
by the time the desserts came
after they had
the sitter looked
although emma nodded
when aidan motioned
after she headed
when emma returned
"instead , water splashed"
"broke , `` she muttered"
when he produced
as an indian love song flowed
this time he did
"instead , he wrapped"
when the song finished
they just waited
"thankfully , it was"
when she turned
his thumb brushed
"by then , she did"
"want mama , `` he pleaded"
her answer did
her necklace and the beaded sari seemed
we  will take
that statement caused
"when her phone beeped , she reached"
the baby is
a whoop went
"i mean , the hospital is"
"with a snort , megan added"
his expression then would have
as her aunts started
the party is
as pesh rose
when she accidentally touched
then they headed
the necklace and earrings weighed
the group made
"within a few seconds , aidan appeared"
collective oohs and aahs went
when caroline scrunched
a nurse exited
i might get
whether or not they would have
chapter twenty-two although her stomach screamed
a voice asked
and because she was
not only had
their first day in the city had
a combination of jetlag and lust had
today they had
with a teasing
part of their sightseeing had
as she passed
"to her , he had"
since she was
his loving gaze took
the entire world seemed
she just stared
the woman scowled
his smile grew
by the time they pushed
"like two mischievous kids , they raced"
"once inside , they wrapped"
as he ravaged
the tight bodice was
the black and pink panties were
not quite the polite gentleman she had
when she cleared
"breathless , she pulled"
as he loomed
"finally , he obliged"
while he gave
the friction eased
"over the fabric of her bodice , he kissed"
just as he reached
"with one quick movement , she was"
as his breath hitched
as he added
"just as pesh 's teeth dug into one of the bows on her stockings , megan 's ringtone for mason blared"
as mason rattled
a sheepish expression came
his head fell
"from this position , she was"
as the pressure began
harder and harder she bounced
his chuckle made
with the feel of his arm wrapped
i  will leave
"her feet , encased"
the two men in her life looked
"the judge , in his ominous black robe , gazed"
the closer they got
the judge adjusted
but i would have
although she hated
i often say
and you unwaveringly rose
their attention was
"john , percy , and georgie were"
balloons and flowers filled
"over the dining room archway , there was"
as megan started
"through the crack in the door , she could see"
"at the sound of his singing , she had"
good times never seemed
"in his arms , caroline began"
as aidan scowled
caroline cooed at his question and kicked
"trust me , i know"
as caroline smiled
"and as far as you and more babies , you  will know"
and if anyone is
"immediately , his face flushed"
his eyes bulged
epilogue as soon as he finished
"even now , the usual ten-minute drive home seemed"
he anxiously drummed
he  would tried
"more than anything , he relished"
because mason adored
his girls were
the two of them looked
every aspect of the pregnancy and birth had
the girls arrived
"six weeks later , they were"
since sara remained
as he stared
for all the years of struggle and heartache he had
his heart was
once they learned
"at just six weeks old , his girls were"
he  would ended
she probably represented
a fleeting smile appeared
it must be
the sight caused
his mouth worked
just as he started
"three-year-old noah and his two-year-old sister , caroline , made"
"well , her expression was"
"at almost four-and-a-half , he was"
noah and caroline followed
"in the end , it would be"
a week before he had
while caroline had
with emma nearing
"noah ran to him next , and he got"
a cry from the living room snapped
as emma worked
"with a sigh , aidan dropped"
"truly , i do"
with maya still taking
as patrick recited
"three years ago , the dining room would have"
"most likely , he would have"
"across from him , he had"
"at the end of the day , true love in its many forms was"
"yes , i know"
she  would come
even that was
no one sitting
but now the cat was
i  would seen
"not my usual milieu , but my sister had"
so imagine my surprise when she came
when i finally looked
when i see
"anything else , she was"
shiane ; she was
"some on again , off again deal with a kid who was"
and i always let
though it seemed
"like cynthia , that night when i  would called"
as much of a bastard as i am
the program said
my back was
when i helped
once we got
i also had
like the fact that her shyness and hesitance was
my first order of business was
by the time the bell chimed
i usually let
i  will find
when i made
the night sure was
her waist was
"another first , i usually avoided"
my new baby was
"no sleeping in the buff tonight , i  would changed"
she just cuddled
but this whatever it was
"first time in thirteen years , that i did"
"besides , i do"
her shirt had
my control lasted
when she nuzzled
how the f * * k was
since i kind of gave
instead i pressed
but now that i was
i  would saved
and then after i  would been
that day was
when i  would confronted
he  would only been
so for a few months the world thought we were
all i could do
now here i am
the business suit sure had
his story was
from what i remember
then he  would invented
though kid was
no words were
his hands glided
but that way he touched
my face heated
downstairs in the kitchen he kissed
"princess , how did"
when i take
it almost sounded
the supportive family who was
we might have
like he said
"not necessarily a skirt chaser , it seems"
none of his encounters if i remember
because if it was
that as something else donnie had
he  would said
chapter 4 trace i did
i  would turned
this just might be
everything about her called
by the time i took
outside her apartment i looked
so i was
if there were
monday morning i had
the last two days had
i  would already called
"not from any storybook , but from the way i  would seen"
or the way she was
but here i was
the weekend had
in fact i have
neither of us seemed
downstairs there were
what he did
i almost called
by the end of day when it was
as soon as i got
my assistant called
my mouth came
she  would learned
now she got
her back bowed
her taste was
my c * * k was
her legs came
i finally released
when the bed started
my sweet girl squeezed
instead i teased
the combination was
the sheets were
her ass incited
her face heated
so much for giving
with my face buried
her mouth was
the last thought had
"one look , it had"
for a man like me it was
i would never have
the cool air of the ac dried
and the way she responded
her answer was
the more i had
this time when i came
we finally made
i guess i was
looks like i was
her voice is
when i  would made
there might be
though i  would save
but now that she  would asked
i also know
i  would done
the only problem is
look at this way ; at least we both know
if the last few hours are
as time goes
my mind was
"in the space of a few short days , it seems"
but this latest was
"somehow , he did"
"still , i had"
the things he  would made
my body has
could a man really make
the though caused
not since i learned
"to me , they are"
his hand dropped
fuck i was
pretty soon i was
she almost gagged
she soon got
when my balls were
her voice had
"in the morning , i awakened"
"with my hand on her hip , i controlled"
"and each night , i came"
her upcoming show was
she  would never lived
i just looked
"as her man , it was"
and though our relationship had
she could get
my assistant was
my first instinct was
that night when she called
and the fact that she had
i almost caved
"finally , i lowered"
i bit into the flesh of her back to her neck before pulling
"in the kitchen , i ignored"
from what they  would said
"along with that , the reports on her manager were"
before i confronted
we could never go
i never took
chapter 8 things settled
her career was
this time i was
shiane trace has
i especially loved
now i have
"not because of the show itself , no , trace had"
i no longer had
one tabloid had
he  would gone
apparently whatever he  would done
of course now we were
trace her show was
i  would made
after this series of engagements were
my hand went
wordlessly i started
at first her shyness ruled
when i was
"satisfied with her answer , i guided"
her ass was
i bit into her neck just as the last of my sperm was
her manager was
the buzz was
you would never know
the song was
but what i did
the amazing this was
that could be
as soon as his hand fisted
the next day i was
some hack had
for some reason my answer pissed
now she pulled
her talent did
then he did
by now my rage was
"well f * * k , that sure stopped"
the memory seemed
just because you  are
"just a warning for the future babe , you do"
if i say
i  would gone
instead i helped
once again i recalled
"and the hunger , humiliation , all the things you can expect"
and then when lily came
my heart had
with my hands holding
"the morning after our engagement , he  would dropped"
i guess they never banked
i  would wanted
in the end he convinced
my tour started
he  would hired
he  would threatened
in the end they  would come
one day we were
as he slipped
he  would given
i guess that ship had
our wedding was
he  would moved
that last was
the way he seethed
trace never took
and so my daughter was
allison screams on the other end in response-she knows what a huge deal this is
they might be
"i wince , thinking"
not that miriam and allison are
she and miriam have
the lawn rooms have
as wonderful as my two best friends are
not that i do
particularly when it comes
that post-sex glazed
and i promised
this crew party is
i still remember
his nose was
"with his looks , money , and being"
tonight i have
"i never usually wear anything but chapstick , but i watched"
"with a start , i recognize"
"with a little makeup on , my resemblance to my mom is"
everyone always says
the shirt is
chapter two the spring night air is
then all those papers would have
a couple guys chilling
the lights are
"a tall , brawny guy says"
cara and i follow
"cara and foster keep chatting , and though cara makes"
one of these two rooms must be
"good lord , his body is"
the line down between his six-pack looks like it was
i glance over his shoulder and see
the girl says
chapter three the words are
"um , do"
pierce and i were
could she and pierce be
i guess i  would be
my mom is
i always promised
i so hoped
as wonderful as i know
its architecture is
"i mean , how long have"
nate thornhill is
i can not believe
"wait , does"
the heat from his leg under the table is
"wow , that was"
"my mom asks , glancing"
the waitress comes
"dom perignon , i see"
"whoa , he must be"
my new stepdad must be
i manage to do
"my mom gasps in excitement , but i see"
"consulting of k street , and we  are"
oh my god-is pierce going
it  will be
everything will be
we  would moved
my whole body is
"with his other hand , nate takes"
he  will have
my life has
nate surprises me by leaning
and now he will always know
my biggest worry was
and the house is
i gasp at the flagstone mansion we  are
the maid just comes
"after the tour , which took"
my head is
"if anything , though , my sex dreams about him have"
a canopy with a delicate white fabric settled
"a matching nightstand , bureau , and vanity make"
the wallpaper is
the potomac is
two varsity sports are
"actually , pierce looked"
"apparently , she cheated"
a girl i dated
"my mom asks , excitedly flying"
i  would rather be
i wish she were
he actually went
maybe i know
the truth is
pierce and nate start talking
"oh man , she really makes"
"oh my god , i have"
i head into the foyer but at the last second decide not to go
i guess they  are
the lights downstairs are
i just ... i was
it just sort of happened
"his eyes , which were"
i stumble forward and take
i just resisted
"of course , the downside is"
my outlook is
"very important , `` she says"
i really do
"constance asks , breaking"
"constance exclaims , sitting"
"i nod , feeling"
i glance up to see
i notice that nate did
i guess he does
i just ... you know
i should get
"she whispers , leaning"
and that girl said
"i ask , knowing"
i mean before my mom and i got
"well , three , including"
he must have
he can be
"but only for the last few weeks , and- `` `` ok ... but what if you did"
and then even if you were
i try to get
i park in the garage and let
the huge house is
nate must still be
first days are
"i stare at it blankly , not understanding"
the mirror above the sink is
a shiver of excitement runs through me at the idea that nate could actually be
"i freeze , holding"
who  would be
maybe an ungainly mouse is
the noises sounded
the swinging door is
"sheesh , does"
"i ask , moving"
from the blood smeared
"i ask , my eyes moving"
the first was
"i glance up sharply , but his eyes are"
"his smell of sweat , beads of it still dripping"
"i ask , raising"
"just like that , the one real conversation that my stepbrother and i have"
the only swimsuit i have
we quickly slipped
i notice nate lagging
"jackson kicks off his flip-flops and jumps in , his splash narrowly missing"
"nate slowly walks toward the chair furthest from me , and takes"
"um , where do"
my family has
what sport do
"nate asks , appearing"
"chapter ten in the end , i have"
the dining room table is
maybe we could get
"nate asks , frowning"
"i exchange a polite smile with natasha , who is"
i  will do
"dude , come"
a rush of footsteps up the stairs makes
"i mean , am"
"i furiously brush it away and nate backs up , running"
"for the record , you just looked"
"i ask , picking"
"i whisper , feeling"
as our lips come
"i whisper , falling"
apparently we  will get
the shift dress is
the food is
i spot my mom talking
"oh , go"
luckily the day is
the temperature has
"i pause , admiring"
sometimes i forget i do
i never wanted
"i mean , maybe at first i was"
my fears are
clearly nate gets
my best friend just got
"oh my gosh , i did"
"like nate , though he says"
hope these drinks are
the idea that it could be
a woman has
"chapter thirteen `` oh no , `` i whisper , sitting"
"i mean , when did"
"the , you know"
we  will probably have
"i shrug , feeling"
"i head back down to the party , taking"
but i know
i glance around at the dimming
if his dad has
just another hour or so and the fireworks will be
my mom does
the crowd cheers as an especially colorful firework goes
you and my dad are
when my mom abandoned
"i glance at the people around me , their faces"
maybe it was
because now i realize
chapter fourteen i was
"or at least , i have"
"i finish eating and click around the internet for a while , feeling"
i would never leave
a sound behind me makes
"talk to you later , `` i say"
sure that i was
"i hesitate , realizing"
"i murmur , hurrying"
the whiff of alcohol coming
i barely have
"his mouth tastes like whiskey , but i do"
"i pause , then follow"
his world is
i should probably go
your door is
"anyway , they got"
nothing to do
"i shout , feeling"
"pierce asks , wiggling"
"for about a week , a handful of photographers waited"
as for nate and me ... `` so it  will just be
how many times have
"responsibility , responsibility , responsibility , `` pierce says"
angry as i am
"i call , pulling"
my mind wandered
"so , have"
the wait staff is
my parents are
but greg is
"but sure enough , there he is"
"cousins , maybe , `` nate observes , leaning"
but then it happened
before i know
his urgency takes
his abs are
i just was
i glance at him to make
his eyes are
"ok , one more : why are"
"i nod , sensing"
i like the feeling of lying
the woman who accused
"i ask , taking"
"nate asks , tilting"
and now that pierce has
"i glance up , frowning"
but if you keep
otherwise i could lose
and off we go
the temperature on this august day is
we  will see
"in short order , we  are"
my mom can be
i glance back toward him and follow
i always just pictured
"i reply , quickly reaching"
"i protest , grabbing"
"i ask , hoping"
now that we  are
"i nod and smile , trying"
"i ask , pointing"
"by this time of the summer , it  will be"
and the edges of the leaves are
"i repeat , walking"
"i gasp and turn , frantically grabbing"
"i reply , realizing"
think you  are
as we make
maybe she was
"nate asks , rolling"
plus my heart is
chapter twenty `` are
as soon as the swinging
even though his words are
i still have
i step under the hot stream of water and take
"or at least , i know"
i suddenly have
his appearance right now is
the idea of being
i nod and realize
"in contrast to our recent urgent caresses , this one is"
perhaps because we know
the tightness and size of his muscles always takes
the arch of his cock is
i pause and then take
"i obey , reaching"
normally when nate takes
he abruptly takes
i watch as he holds
his lips find
but everything nate is
the slightly new angle is
"i completely lose control , my body arching"
the sensation of him leaving
my first kiss was
his tongue just sort of darted
"and then senior year , and freshman year of college , a few guys took"
which of course just made
she never really learned
"i obey , turning"
"i ask , befuddled"
just as long as you  are
i glance at the clock and am
"well , i guess i did"
"but of course , having"
nate and my mom both leave
pierce and my mom find
"i lean forward , trailing"
"i circle my tongue lightly around his tip , licking"
i guess i expected
the combination of his fingers on my clit and his cock inside me is
my legs are
maybe it would make
my energy has
what kind of relationship would that be
these kind of questions are
and nate has
"on my end , i do"
i really have
and there are
we eventually make
the lace is
not exactly what i needed
"second of all , you  are"
my relationship with nate is
"if anything , my conversation with allison has"
when i get
"i mean , allison would have"
"i ask , nudging"
before i have
"from the kitchen , and are"
i almost referenced
"after dinner , nate and i leave"
we always make
my body quivers with excitement just thinking
the bra is
the next thing i know
"i ask , turning"
the first time i tried
"i try , but do"
his fingers run
i gasp as he makes
then his tongue is
the full contact is
my mouth is
"i obey , inching"
once i get
the pleasure has
i almost faint with relief as he takes
his hand still holding
i never realized
a second orgasm takes
"i mumble , reaching"
if we  are
"chapter twenty-four the next day , thornhill and co. is"
apparently the tech crowd is
"constance talks to me happily in our cubicle , the awkwardness of our first day of working"
i  will give
"pierce and roderick , his business partner , stand by the buffet , happily talking"
pierce smiles at me as constance and i make
could you come
"i march to the door , taking"
i manage to make
when pierce comes
i step back to give
nate frowns at me slightly and i know
"i ask , startled"
i glance at nate and see
"wow , `` i snap , tossing"
i freeze and take
"in a saner moment , i might have"
"well , to be"
"but , see"
when pierce was
i glance out the window next to the door and see
his face is
"eileen sits down with a muted cry , and i run"
whatever mistakes we made
"from now on , let"
he  will come
"i collapse against her , burying"
"but clearly , i do"
his words keep
my mom did
"my stomach grumbles , reminding"
i sigh and get
"he plants himself between the island and the fridge , trapping"
if he expects
but i should have
his carefully crafted
"god , was"
"goodbye , nate , `` i say"
both the car and our old house were
the car is
it only took
our old life is
but of course it did
to never have
one that i know
"i nod , then remember"
my eye catches on a flash of white on the lower lawn : nate sitting
i glance in the rearview mirror to get
your husband slapped
"my mom sobs once , reaching"
"i ask , changing"
relief because i  will have
"foolishly , i had"
just after four-almost time for my dinner shift in the cafeteria to be
"i open my door to the lawn , smiling"
with pierce and my mom getting
"brynn , i was"
and it specifically included
as soon as i signed
"i mean , did"
"i mean , it seems"
"man , this is"
"i touch my lips with my fingertips , wondering"
chapter twenty-nine realizing i now have
allison and i have
"ugh , i was"
the waiter walks over and is
"allison flags down the waiter , and by the time our first round has"
"miriam asks , leaning"
"allison asks , cocking"
the late summer night has
the front door swings open and i press my lips together as i see
but there he is
a chill comes
i really am
"she nods , a wide smile covering"
my eyes dart over his shoulder as i see
if you had
they share a smile and a few murmured words before she continues
anything so that i do
"tears spring to my eyes-oof , that was"
like i had
here you were
what my father had
all the things that you were
that i had
"and your tuition , well , i figured"
risk my heart being
everything about him is
the words have
my legs almost give
"cara asks , her eyes darting"
"sure enough , eileen is"
the living room has
i barely manage to get
i must have
the pain is
the extra power is
"his tongue moves down to my opening , darting"
his legs are
"his nose nuzzles into the side of my cheek , his lips just finding"
"nate asks , walking"
once such a big deal for him to say
"a year later , and his kisses still make"
i finally get
we both managed
my world before you came
"every day , i find"
the end chapter one `` i thought you said
she and i have
"but even so , our ideas of what makes"
"riley asks with mock astonishment , gesturing"
"with a wild yell , some kid tries to swing"
there must be
the short answer is
"i squeak , ducking"
"or whatever , `` i say"
i groan as a volley of chuckles goes
our connecticut town has
"he , on the other hand , had"
"until this year , that is"
"i stare wordlessly at emerson , knocked"
"by now , but emerson has"
her name was
i begrudgingly agreed
"still , i did"
"emerson interrupts my thoughts , grinning"
goosebumps spring up where his fingertips glanced
because our school is
if it did
but the gods of popularity did
"my very petite , nerdy , soft-spoken self is"
but as i attempt to make
"i collide with his muscular form , my hands landing"
"i step quickly away , catching"
"i ask , laughing"
he could have
and it seems
"but right now , she seems"
"hey abby , `` courtney haines says"
"i exclaim , looking"
and would be
and courtney is
"riley asks , stealing"
"i glance over at him , amazed"
"courtney chirps , rubbing"
"i murmur , wanting"
"which , in my opinion , is"
"or at least , something other than generally bored"
so who wants
"courtney asks , her green eyes sparkling"
"riley crows triumphantly , shooting"
a chorus of assenting
the crowd makes
her closet is
"he , on the other hand , is"
"emerson snaps , suddenly on the defensive , `` invaded"
my dad and deborah have
how the hell did
"emerson grins , slipping"
my head sets to spinning
"from this close , i can see"
his arm is
a cast of seriousness has
"i ask , nodding"
"hand them over , `` emerson says"
i  will never have
that seriousness has
but my sense has
my breath comes
"i step out of them , wobbling"
unless he intends
"those soft , sculpted"
"the pounding music cuts off abruptly , and through the cacophony ringing"
or maybe i was
i  will never know
"luckily , emerson is"
"i demand , planting"
"i reply , crossing"
as far as strange sensations go
"emerson asks , one eye almost cracking"
"i screech , my stomach dropping"
i stare at his retreating
no way is
barely a word is
"emerson , for his part , seems"
but of course he is
dad and deborah must be
"with a little bit of luck , we  will be"
my room is
"i flip over onto my back , staring"
"with a pang of heartache , i realize"
"then again , he probably never would have"
"there , hidden among a jumble of makeup and jewelry , is"
its actual purpose is
"the mere thought of his broad , capable hands is"
the silence that first fell
my handsome housemate may as well be
i could have
"without preamble , riley swerves violently onto the shoulder of the main road , causing"
guys like emerson do
you could take
the rest of these assholes will have
the stress of college applications and ap course work coupled
"hi deb , `` i mutter gloomily , standing"
though emerson and i are
her voluminous platinum blonde hair is
between the tits and her habit of wearing
my question is
and you certainly do
"i glance over at my father , silently begging"
as grating as deb can be
but deborah has
the uncomfortable silence between us is
what should we do
though things might get
this boy can even making
i just have
"i cry out , exasperated"
not unless we can have
"despite the context of his offer , my stomach still does"
"at this moment , it does"
you guys are
"i step out the door after him , shaking"
"true , he and his mother have"
what kind of shit do
but instead of giving
maybe he just does
a song by the foo fighters comes
he just wants
i just happen
chapter three the crystal dawn is
"high school kids , senior citizens , working"
"i ask , stepping"
most people just happen
"damn , do"
maybe all this lovey-dovey nonsense is
that one takes
but the real reason is
but now that the moment has
girl on girl hate is
"i ask , my voice going"
the rest of the restaurant seems
this one little moment could be
"with my heart in my throat , i let"
"those mere inches of space spark with electricity , searing"
but when i recognize
i try to keep
his name is
he very nearly derailed
the sound of his voice is
i  will get
the sudden concern clouding
our food has
"emerson asks , reaching"
"shame and relief crash simultaneously over me , rendering"
"his look , infused"
"his simple request acts as a life preserver , saving"
"without pause , emerson reaches for the hand that is"
"i remember , through my thick fog of misery , that he must have"
his simple touch was
"i ask , forcing"
but the second we  are
his hand is
anger floods in to replace
this place has
his usual grin has
"after our disastrous outing before , this evening is"
maybe we  will even get
"clearly , miracles do"
the savory fragrance of his recipe makes
unless we  are
i can practically see
maybe there was
the big meal has
and as we both lose
"i snuggle against his side , resting"
the warmth of his body is
"at long last , the screen goes"
the house is
"but even so , neither of us makes"
"his blue eyes gleam even in the darkness , and his caring"
"no , `` i say"
and this whole us-getting-along thing is
"i ask , sitting"
"in the closet , during that stupid game ... you were"
if the cops had
before i can take
"in this moment , there is"
"the full , stiffening"
"i stammer , my eyes springing"
and like emerson says
deb and dad are
they  will never know
my dad all but carries
a two-for-one relapse is
"deb squeals , kicking"
emerson and i trade baffled
there on her hand is
safe to say
my eyes go
thanks for at least waiting
after everything we shared
but how the hell am
what the hell are
but as absurd as this all is
my nerves have
"silently , we make"
"good people , but loaded"
i just- `` `` did
our fingers are
"i whisper , pulling"
"by sunday , we  will technically be"
"yet , `` emerson says"
"i reply , my eyes going"
but i have
"i crow , wiping"
"despite the crapiness of the whole situation , here we are"
when we were
the short answer to your question is
the slightly longer answer is
"anyway , he teased"
right when my mom died
his parents were
"if i  would known- `` `` what , you would have"
"i tease , trying"
"with his popularity , his family 's reputation in town ... i would n't have"
i  would rather get
the sky is
we  would probably hardly even see
later that evening
maybe riley will let
"to my surprise , he makes"
"but of course , they  are"
"for once , their narcissism is"
"my grandparents , frank and jillian rowan , adore me , but their relationship with my dad is"
grandpa frank is
grandma and grandpa have
they really adored
"most of the money for my schooling , clothing , and extracurriculars still comes"
"i ask , whipping"
a whole bunch of people are
i should know
what the hell gives
my concentration has
"but as usual , my entrance into homeroom goes"
"without a word , she takes"
"i exclaim , letting"
i glance up only to find
"what , are"
"she whispers , giving"
but just as we  are
i must be
"i stammer , smiling"
"in a matter of minutes , my heart has"
his smallest action has
if i make
we both risked
and that might be
"i smile , grabbing"
that  will take
though not nearly as thrilling
the motel sits right on the edge of the dunes overlooking
the spring air is
my reservations about staying
after all these years of wanting
the menu is
"the buttery , flaky pastry makes"
his face takes
"i ask , pausing"
they never had
the problem is
and it worked
"like , since he lost"
we even go
by the time we make
the whole being-alone thing is
"our chests rise and fall together , our limbs shifting"
"by all rights , i should be"
my blonde hair is
my sex is
his fingertips brush against the thin panel of cotton covering
"i ask , glancing"
we already decided
"i exclaim , `` but- `` `` we  are"
"i laugh , touching"
the fizzy wine tickles my nose as i take
"somehow , this feels nearly as intimate as what just went"
"finally , i come"
"even after one night , the feel of waking"
"i glance up at him , wondering"
the day only gets
"after i treat myself to a long , hot bath and get"
maybe we can find
but we  will be
even though my memories of that night with him are
as if sensing
awkward silences are
since before anything even happened
"i reply , my voice an octave higher than it usually is"
the thing we decided
and i always will be
"now , because this world is"
"because tomorrow , our parents are"
and if any part of you is
"emerson lifts me into his lap , cradling"
the taste of him is
"the tip of his tongue flicks against the hard peak , sending"
that night seems
with his eyes locked
"i work my mouth along him , using"
his cock is
a moan fills my throat as he parts my silky flesh with his staggering
"a low , thudding"
"emerson lowers himself down next to me on the bed , pulling"
but the thing is
but even though emerson and i had
his hair is
we both know
if only ... `` `` i know
"hopefully , by the time we get"
frank and gillian are
he and my grandparents are
a shadow of the relationship we used
the only things unappealing
"i watch , trying"
her rhinestone-encrusted heels must be
"she squeals , leaping"
"god , `` deb breathes , splaying"
"well , `` grandma says"
"deb chirps , giving"
"deb falters , looking"
"i glance at emerson , embarrassed"
"deb , not knowing"
the jolly official says
"emerson walks out ahead of me , keeping"
more than being
our gazes say
"emerson and i , still dressed"
"as of this afternoon , when the ink dried"
this feeling of running
"he plants one hand on either side of me , caging"
the fight goes
the prospect of sleeping
two hysterical voices rage at each other as other objects go
"deb weeps , charging"
"deb shrieks , falling"
"my dad roars , charging"
the smell of booze seeping
"i gasp , staring"
"my dad returns , whirling"
he simply makes
"and this time , i know"
"i glance around the house , at all the artifacts of my childhood that were"
the future that will never come
"i sit there at the foot of the steps for hours , listening"
but who am
to our splintered
"i whisper , looking"
some teachers eventually pulled
my heart can take
"over the course of the tumultuous next few months , the entire sordid saga comes"
"on the morning after their wedding , dad and deb were"
only when it was
all i know
the bender dad started
and even though nothing had
"in no time at all , the marriage was"
if emerson wanted
as painful as it is
"in the past six years , riley has"
a little color will be
"thanks , `` i sigh , taking"
you can give
every time i see
after the brawl that ensued
"riley insists , giving"
i never pictured
if i get
the bastian offices are
"these days , it has"
the walls are
the people running
as if a place this cool would ever have
i guess being
even if this is
"i ask , happily accepting"
sorry ... did
the job is
one of our managing
"i guess with the fast-paced aspect of the tech world , hiring"
"three weeks vacation ... `` i stare at him , practically salivating"
but this whole situation is
"absolutely , `` i grin , `` this is"
"very good , `` cooper says"
"but for today , just go"
what a screwy industry this is
this day could not get
so blinded am
the face looking
emerson sawyer is
"and from the look in those all too familiar eyes , i know"
and what the hell am
"i breathe , spinning"
"in the last eight years , his gorgeousness has"
"i wonder , `` i reply , rolling"
"i reply , raising"
if saturday is
the best i can do
"she squeals , rushing"
"if anything , his working"
"i ask , shaking"
"riley shrieks , pulling"
"now , all of a sudden , fate has"
"second , even if i did"
"so , this is"
"and just like that , the matter is"
"a super sexy , super loaded"
the birthday boy is
"a gray blazer , light slacks , and trendy suede loafers have"
the place is
"i almost laugh , remembering"
i gape as a martini appears
"the server , dressed"
the kind that ought to be
and this is
"i ask , stunned"
old age has
"nice town , you know"
the app craze was
"with a little bit of luck , and a whole lot of venture capital backing , the thing took"
"overnight , everything was"
so instead of going
"i ask , staring"
my grandparents took
so you still get
"i smile , touched"
"sure , `` i tease , `` whatever you say"
"i ask , with mounting"
"i ask , `` you  are"
but the memory of the beat down he gave
all that feeling
"and hey , now that you  are"
i never gave
"i ask , exasperated"
your social media presence was
"for a while , i scoped"
but once you got
not with everything that had
"between that and the gleam in his eye , his intentions are"
"my new coworkers , as it were"
"emerson asks , as the stylish threesome comes"
the man called
"and from the barely-concealed amusement on his face , i know"
"i charge away , back up to my haven on the upper west side , struggling"
"by the time i glance at my bedside clock , i see"
chapter fourteen it seems
one look at my face and she does
but abby ... you have
"riley laughs , shaking"
which would be
"me : hey , i was"
him : so do
"me : oh , i do"
"i gasp , yanking"
at least i made
"still , even knowing"
"fine , `` i mutter , going"
"emerson grins , as i swing"
the glasses are
"actually , they  are"
"emerson asks , laying"
"not my idea of a good time , but they  are"
i guess this is
"i laugh , turning"
"i stare at the tiny gift , my mind and heart making"
his favorite old joke from when we were
whatever the case may be
but with everything that actually ended
"through every other relationship , and date , and fling , i always had"
i force myself to take
the heat and nearness of him are
"i clench my thighs together , acutely aware of the throbbing"
my every barrier and defense goes
the feel of him pressing
"i laugh dementedly , leaping"
her game face is
"no , `` i mumble bashfully , `` i did"
"riley asks , making"
"happy birthday , abby , `` emerson says"
the three of us settle
"riley asks , whipping"
as if he needed
what time is
"i exclaim , standing"
frank and jillian rowan have
this should be
rich people do
but i earned
"emerson asks , catching"
"i nod , clutching"
and the second it does
my grandfather says
"a long moment of silence unfolds as my grandparents stare at me , absolutely seething"
"i reply , taken"
"my grandmother asks , her nose wrinkled"
"grandma hisses , grabbing"
"i exclaim , `` i do"
"grandpa shouts , slamming"
he never recovered
no one forced
no one made
and even if deb and her husband did
terrible things can happen
"jillian , do"
i actually let
i ... i do
if we do
how can you be
how dare they say
especially when that grudge is
the injustice of it all has
and they  are
"i stagger over to the couch , curling"
the very thought of losing
"in that moment , i know"
my stomach is
with my cushy free housing likely to be
so i guess my only choice is
"speaking of emerson , he did"
between our steamy make
"of the dozen or so other employees , no one else seems"
"i call , glancing"
for something to do
"emerson teases , eyeing"
"i chirp , playing"
"i laugh , sipping"
thank god i remembered
"out of the corner of my eye , i see"
it might get
maybe even feeling
"i ask , trailing"
"i ask , digging"
"i breathe , glancing"
the entire space inside is
this entire building is
"huge , towering"
the design is
the appliances and decor are
"the tiny dog collides with my legs , tail wagging"
"i ask , leaning"
"the food smells amazing , the wine is"
today may have
"i exclaim , feigning"
the delicious wine has
"a sleek dresser and wide window round out the space , and a few well-placed keepsakes make"
someone who loved
"his tongue glides against mine , caressing"
"i bury my fingers in his hair , letting"
but while our bodies find
his every muscle is
no need for things to be
"in a matter of minutes , our naked bodies are"
the sudden jolt of force coupled
the illicit thrill is
"i barrel toward the edge of bliss , blinded"
"with an elated scream , i come"
"emerson drinks me up , unable to get"
in the throbbing
"i brace myself , lifting"
"i press myself back into his every thrust , taking"
our bodies are
that our whole lives have
"man , has"
"i laugh , giving"
his features are
"i cry out , tumbling"
"emerson mumbles , snapping"
"and secondly , i did"
"and now , when i finally get"
"in no time flat , she has"
i nearly faint as i see
a dozen faces
"i , on the other hand , am"
delighted chuckles go
the room goes
but instead of this being
his jolly demeanor has
the transformation is
"i hurry in after him , feeling"
"in fact , i just might be"
"emerson replies , `` i take"
"cooper shoots back , `` is"
because you take
what explanation could you possibly have
"we , uh , know"
his entire body is
"our boss cries , shrinking"
"just a few days ago , i was"
and now here we are
and all because we tried
"and yet , here it all is"
why would they do
and why losing
like every bit of context organizing
"for now , just having"
"so much for that bright , shiny future i  would been"
no one at that company wants
but with everything that went
"surely , they  are"
his knuckles go
"i ask , `` that job is"
"but , `` i stammer , resting"
and what i care about above all is
that we were
my family- `` `` your family is
the westie goes
before i can say
"shudderingly , i remember"
"sure , i worked"
she  would be
so then who could possibly be
"i breathe , paralyzed"
this address was
six months is
"really , not since his falling"
his endless cycle of relapses and recoveries has
my dad and i have
"with great care , dad takes"
and all i had
that relief gives
"sure , `` emerson says"
"my dad smiles , faintly but resolutely , gives"
"for a moment , the only movement in the room comes"
"when emerson finally swings his gaze my way , his eyes are"
"i laugh softly , `` he really did"
"emerson breathes , taking"
"i press myself to him , bringing"
our kiss is
"i ask , wiping"
"i stammer , all my composure going"
no one can take
but there is
"i grin , running"
only now are
the entire surface is
"for the past year , emerson and i have"
the suite will be
but though we may be
our first batch of apps is
"emerson asks , sliding"
we only just said
the end chapter 1 the sun was
the horrifying thought startled
"five years ago , she  would worked"
but the elegant limousine did
she almost dropped
the pain ripping
"when a tall , dark man with a muscular frame got"
"her green , almond shaped"
he never went
just like today was
"unfortunately , even those nebulous thoughts did"
the sudden burst of pain came
both palms were
her confused eyes looked
"the little girl , who had"
the mother smiled
the child took
"her knees , palms and especially her face were"
but the sight that greeted
"the tall , incredibly gorgeous man asked"
her hair was
her breasts were
the doctor was
"actually , the man who was"
but the handsome man beside him was
as soon as she tried
no sudden moves until the doctor has
"unfortunately , the sudden movement had"
"after several minutes , the room stopped"
"unfortunately , the idea of what a hospital visit would do"
"in her current state of mind , this tall , attractive man was"
"besides the expense of the hospital , he was"
not even if you were
"handsome or not , she hated"
and this one could give
the doctor obviously did
surely it was
"for some reason , dharr did"
and what dharr wanted
the doctor immediately disappeared
"i mean , really , if he acted"
dharr actually smiled
a stranger who could have
yet you know
the compassion in his eyes created
victoria only laughed
her head tilted
"possibly not the moon , but even that might be"
"too young for what , she did"
"besides , twenty is"
but he resisted
when nothing happened
"at the split in the curtains , she suddenly stopped"
but the man was
she  would already missed
chapter 2 victoria buried
no matter how much victoria tried
but victoria loved
"unfortunately , victoria did"
usually jasmine was
strong arms reached
we really have
victoria quickly released
it actually ached
"besides her mother , no one had"
"odd , but she  would blocked"
but she did
victoria instantly smiled
her smile faded
the idea of someone suing
the women of his acquaintance were
or they were
he almost dreaded
"until that moment , he determined"
just like in her dream last night and she suspected
the other students actually moved
she also noticed
his designs were
"scott , what am"
other students were
you should see
the happiness she encouraged
"and outside , she was"
now if that bulging
"plenty of quiet at my place , `` he assured"
just hop into the shower and then come
"besides , dharr is"
he  would demanded
the dress was
her cleavage was
chapter 3 victoria stared
she  would modeled
just a touch of liner to your eyes would make
you both make
victoria just rolled
the purse did
dinner that night was
most people do
her grin was
not everyone needed
his thumb was
but the other half of him wanted
but each time she questioned
"each time , she  would waited"
"thankfully , he took"
their bodies touched
her surprised eyes glanced
his hand lifted
"instantly , his tongue entered"
so he pulled
the desire she  would seen
although no one had
or he could find
since he wanted
not only would he never deign to do
and it went
because of where he was
for other women he  would been
and the fact that victoria was
so when my suitemate asked
"and over dinner , i noticed"
"besides , the men you have"
victoria obviously preferred
the picnic basket was
the leaves had
"absently , she wondered"
she simply waved
but dharr pulled
her body arched
but he stopped
and his hair was
if anything showed
and since he  would answered
like you  are
he  would inherited
the smaller countries or companies were
she  would known
and the idea of never making
none of my friends ever had
victoria could see
"but again , his eyes showed"
but i promise you that they are
the ideas flashed
his advisors have
"now , looking"
it would take
the decision was
victoria would be
she would eventually find
if she ever asked
"besides , any guard stationed"
his elite forces were
how could the man go
but he reveled
instead of telling
the meat was
the evening was
"but the majority of the time , she answered"
for every one question she was
"the whole time though , she was"
she  would stopped
but her being
"finally , he gave"
the food had
so there was
the pulse at the base of her throat sped
"instantly , victoria did"
but the reality was
what he made
as soon as they were
"thankfully , exams are"
"in a way , it was"
she  would remembered
"slowly , she came"
all her friends had
"with a small , hard kiss , he turned"
the next two months were
"but instead of her gangly friend , a bulky , dark and angry looking"
he rarely bothered
they just looked
"an hour later , they were"
the phone did
they both breathed
she  would done
and why was
all the anger was
this phone has
a part of her wanted
the second incident occurred
but victoria had
how long are
his tone brooked
i work just enough hours to buy
the only thing that stopped
his voice was
no one ordered
excuse me but i have
my shift is
"without another word , victoria snapped"
even her manager laughed
she still had
she  would backed
each time he touched
and the feelings were
"that day , he  would ended"
the only words he said
"a moment later , he was"
her manager just slowly started
"so two weeks later , she had"
but he only changed
he always kissed
the library was
at the idea of seeing
he  would followed
the first time he  would ventured
the desire within her was
the fear would be
each simple touch and she was
but it could only be
his plane landed
the idea made
he also wanted
"a tall , gangly man was"
in his hands was
but he remembered
the only other possibility was
the idea blasted
the sight he confronted
he could see
the blanket was
how could she have
but then the blame came
and as he looked
he  would never hated
he  would make
"with seething fury , dharr closed"
the tiny scrap of material covering
her head rolled
his hand dove into her hair and pulled
her soft moans only made
when his finger moved
his mouth still covered
but her body was
the beauty of her climax was
but her next words stopped
the bliss had
he  would imagined
"but in all those fantasies , he was"
so for the past six weeks she had
the guards were
the months after his departure from her life had
the morning he  would said
the real slap in the face came
the caption revealed
the king of ashir finalizes oil leases for great britain the article stated
but some tricky negotiations had
"she , scott and jasmine graduated"
"now , five years later , scott was"
one of the designs victoria had
"for a long moment , she considered"
she could go
"the other option , which seemed"
the kids needed
their parents needed
"besides , she refused"
several of them stopped
betty actually blushed
one of the other office workers called
her mother was
"after another five minutes , mary sniffed and took"
she  would reminded
if i remember
the boy maybe but the girl seems
their parents died
they should take
the untidiness makes
and mary just revealed
will that be
the children will be
"as of this morning , you and your problems did"
the figure was
she  would finally convinced
any time he called
she almost said
"after dharr , she had"
"unfortunately , she had"
no matter how much she tried
and definitely not from their lack of trying
"at every opportunity , they introduced"
"thankfully , scott filled"
the image of the little boy had
"spill it , `` he said"
"sighing , victoria decided"
scott would eventually get
"apparently , the kids are"
the tee-shirt she  would pulled
her hands were
the whole scene was
"after all these years , are"
he definitely had
so why settle for one man when i can have
something inside him made
"after so many years , he still wanted"
so when his niece and nephew had
no matter how much he detested
"and now , he did"
"yes , it was"
and if that did
"after all , had"
they all wanted
he just needed
these kids have
and a king to one of the wealthiest countries in the world with oil reserves so deep and vast that they were
"therefore , you  are"
i can also make
but when they did
"and that of all your ... friends , `` he said"
her anger turned
now that very same man was
and possibly hurting
"around midnight , she slipped"
dharr would see
life just was
it all came
but scott did
he finally had
"unfortunately , wednesday night , she was"
her sole mission was
the driver was
"finally , he got"
the driver then tried
the hard voice that greeted
"nevertheless , she rallied"
but perhaps the teacher was
her complete surrender was
his deep chuckle indicated
then everything would be
and she needed
the car bypassed
the car pulled
he also talked
but the houses were
once inside the impressive and intimating
"inside , there were"
her attention was
the three previous occupants of the room only stared
two small pairs of eyes watched
"without any additional explanation , dharr nodded"
"victoria stood there , wondering"
"finally , ms mattingly cleared"
the governess pursed
arina should be
the memorization ms. mattingly preferred
and bajan was
"finally , ms. mattingly closed"
the governess walked
even a momentary emotion was
the boy did
ms. mattinglly came
the children did
all she wanted
just outside the bedroom was
a fireplace was
but the best part of all was
even her enjoyment of the last few days of school had
the water was
all discussions about the children could be
"good grief , what had"
"sighing , she pushed"
his opinion of her did
the door closing in the outer room alerted
but who on earth would come
security at the palace was
"fortunately , the bubbles were"
and i can come
instead of obeying
your nephew is
their world only makes
"so in his mind , his mother and father are"
what will you do
"with a simple press of a button , the drain to the bathtub opened"
his dark eyes were
the water drained
the towel was
his chest was
but even to her own ears her voice lacked
why would you be
every sensation was
his words did
the idea that he  would been
but it had
a cruel smile twisted
it never was
"chapter 7 the following morning , victoria walked"
she  would mentioned
the pain twisting
the words came
his look was
four sets of eyes looked
"again , arina nodded"
ms. mattingly stepped
but victoria ignored
"after several minutes , she whispered"
"i guarantee that they will last forever , `` victoria said"
both of them turned
when both children nodded
neither child agreed
instead of waiting
as soon as the discussion was
"turning , she was"
the child asked
if dharr or ms. mattingly had
but if bajan had
"eventually , they fell"
some instinct had
"now , seeing"
the children were
the summons came
the odd thing was
this immediacy was
the office was
his desk was
each time she  would started
"but deep down , she had"
this formal man standing
his eyebrows came
her eyes whipped
their brains do
rote memorization is
just your beauty alone is
her mouth dropped
his finger smoothed
the jealousy tearing
her feelings were
the children go
"after all , i do"
"in the past , he had"
the next thirty six hours were
his eyes flared
some of the older ladies were
"at the end of the night , victoria started"
once the last guest had
"at her door , he turned"
she  would ignored
the chemistry was
but if she did
"either way , she was"
"the servant , named"
"one way or another , he would have"
"and back then , he was"
to what do
the action only served
he  would allowed
he just looked
the jacket was
but how did
but although she was
he  would listened
a delicious feeling swelled
"and true to his word , the evening was"
jeffrey and alfred
and if dharr treated
"chapter 9 the next night , three startled"
"and now , even after all these years and all the frank , open talk from others , she still was"
he never looked
victoria almost yelled
it only made
"without a word , he pulled"
but her hand stopped
but his eyes were
"with those words , her hand moved"
only to have
"with her hands in one of his , he flicked"
his indrawn breath showed
one hand moved
his finger slipped
"this time , he  would take"
"and just like the last time , her orgasm was"
and when her eyes opened
her legs moved
but the evidence was
just as it had
"a moment later , the whirlwind started"
"victoria slept , unable to do"
"after five years , he had"
then the memories of the night before came
why in the world would he leave
even the case was
the tears formed
payment for services rendered
last night had
"of all the arrogant , offensive evil things he could have"
at least the last time he  would touched
"five years ago , he  would said"
she  would just fallen
what would happen
that realization was
"and this time , it was"
"but this time , she did"
her tennis shoes were
the man simply stared
and then they  will get
so why do
something about the way she was
so she walked
if they shipped
"thinking of arina and bajan , she hurried"
as soon as she entered
a litter of kittens had
victoria and the children huddled
the three of them trotted
the chef was
when she took
"victoria , arina and bajan made"
his eyes snapped
then the anger rushed
you probably did
"after that , we went"
her bed was
each time a thought of dharr came
if only the morning had
if only she could have
"despite her anger , her body wanted"
his arms were
the sound filled
dharr heard the words and closed
then he let
his moth moved
"within moments , she was"
as their breathing came
she  would stilled
the past two sexual encounters with him had
maybe once she  would recovered
but since he did
as her mouth moved
"that morning , i arrived"
i naturally assumed
the laughter started
"in fact , he only waited"
just because he did
his eyes sharpened
his eyes softened
"with each word , the pain surrounding"
epilogue dharr closed
as soon as he passed
the three of them were
then his eyes moved
his son david said
she almost rolled
in the midst of making
why she even had
as much as she loved
"together , the twins were"
he  would `` rescued
the idea of her boys devising
jobs report getting
her eyes skimmed
a dynasty that had
sam and jacob were
all three animals had
all they needed
the others in the play group were
how nice it would be
but no matter how exhausting
even a man who needed
he  would walked
he could just go
he  would never find
the days were
the idea for her company had
she and her mother had
"at lunch , her assistant placed"
"this man , whoever he was"
she really must have
their food arrived
his boss appeared
when the meal was
until gary realized
"a subtle difference , but one your mind is"
ms. meyers was
"besides , she did"
the valet arrived
"the next day , siri was"
both of them were
both pieces of furniture had
maybe an agitated
this woman who barely reached
linda really did
and she  will be
"at that moment , her cell phone rang and she looked"
"the following night , she dressed"
"with a bright smile , she opened"
"outside , a long limousine was"
the car was
and she definitely loved
"at the end of each night , he took"
"the first night , he kissed"
"after several more minutes of this torment , he pulled"
siri should have
they might have
"with malik , the important part was"
malik definitely was
her breathing was
by the time the car stopped
with the soft glow of the bedside table illuminating
he also loved
his hand reached
when he covered
when her hips pressed
when her head fell
the world could be
"from that night on , whenever he was"
other times he was
she never said
she  would never seen
"other than that , most of my knowledge is"
siri relaxed and leaned
but the picture was
on the front page was
he  would cheated
a full week went
nothing he said
her pain seemed
but never had
she  would trusted
and then the brutal part happened
a pregnancy test confirmed
"and a month later , a sonogram confirmed"
the news that she was
when the letter arrived
the rejection of that letter was
as hard as it had
"after that first month , he had"
the past four years had
the woman he  would known
this woman approached
he  would expect
"once again , he cursed"
his marriage had
so they  would both done
now that the bond was
although the amusing chase was
he  would waited
he  would already cleared
"obviously , this was"
he almost chuckled
and why in the world had
this definitely was
"now , however , she wanted"
his first marriage ended
as if nothing had
as if he had
there she went
"to him , she  would probably just been"
"goodness , why was"
the crash would be
she really just needed
"by the end of this month , we should be"
chapter 3 how could he know
he could only know
"sure enough , there he was"
"dorothy , her assistant , rushed"
tell mary i  will be
"either that , or her boss was"
"yes , that must be"
siri barely hesitated
her clip board fell
her hand stung from the impact and she could see
"with that , she turned"
she  would never asked
he  would never offered
normally they went
the thought of malik finding
but the man did
he  would rejected
she automatically stopped
if the roles were
the issue was
whether he had
a horn honked
the light had
"goodness , they loved"
he might be
he might not believe
if he tossed
since malik had
her finger shook as she pressed
as soon as he listened
"yes , they  are"
"with a sigh , she watched"
the boys loved
as she watched
the warning was
a small part of her hoped that the phone he had
that it was
her tiny little cottage style house was
the family room contained
chapter 4 she was
"with a deep breath , she opened"
an impact she resented
but those feelings that had
"with a moan , she wrapped"
he quickly complied
as he moved
and then he sped
she desperately needed
he simply shifted
"at that moment , it happened"
just as much as he  would learned
her mouth covered
each time she came
and how ready she was
this time he allowed
that man did
she  would give
but if she explained
she really did
the man had
"unfortunately , jacob was"
his chubby little hands were
the fridge is
no excuses and no getting
the sooner both of you are
"without a word , she followed"
he quickly did
how dare you be
those boys are
because you rejected
the opening words had
"a simple signature , no greeting or salutation , a few facts about the pregnancy and that was"
when the letter had
things in duban were
"for the next several hours , malik asked"
m. `` she looked
as she showered
"no charm , no kissing , no making"
something to the right caught her eye and she focused
"no , that was"
"sure enough , as soon as she peered"
"in her mind , it was"
"an heir and a spare , is"
he  would helped
the smells emanating
and they already like tricking
when she received
momma always comes
siri bent over his head and gave
she almost laughed
the questions were
discussions of marriage definitely had
in their home where they can have
that declaration startled
this house alone is
if we can get
"once my guards survey the possibilities , they  will let"
and at least tomorrow she  would be
those questions rose
something other than simply a convenient lay when he was
she  would needed
"okay , not being"
anything that would keep
and if they had
the car seats were
"thankfully , he respected"
the drive to the restaurant was
the restaurant really was
the boys were
"normally , that was"
the waitress quickly arrived
because there was
your hands might have
their eyes grew
the only awkward moment was
"tomorrow , `` she said"
"chapter 8 `` okay , so where are"
but the next step had
"but siri , you have"
he just hoped
this little woman was
the previous tenant died
"in reality , she hated"
every little detail and golden covered
that place had
the books on the shelves were
all of whom were
the hilarity was
or to add
"unfortunately , as he looked"
except when jacob or samuel does
where on earth had
for what might be
"trust me , `` he replied"
"luckily , the driver pulled"
the next house was
the lines were
the carpets were
the kitchen had
"thankfully , there were"
a fact which should make
her imagination was
they  would never made
the feeling had
she even looked
"this time , he wanted"
she really had
"except for the yard , she supposed"
all she cared
"but already , her palms were"
she  would gone
"but her body , so desperate for his touch , ignored"
and then his mouth touched
and when his clothes hindered
she  would denied
"with exultation , he moved"
one he was
as siri came
not that she had
chapter 9 siri watched
the part they loved
for a man who had
not that malik noticed
their pancakes were
"some day , she hoped"
the sooner i leave
"and four years ago , he  would gone"
part of her had
her sons were
he  would only laughed
so what was
she and the boys were
but her body language was
only then did
and his boys were
he  would never known
he never tired
"with determination , he slipped"
"at this point , he did"
"besides , he never hesitated"
or maybe he just had
"and why , why , why did"
maybe she could take
the next few days followed
the only exception to their routine was
but she could barely keep
one night when he called
each phone call was
so much had
she still was
she should be
something in his tone alerted
no little harem women hanging
she really liked
all the tension came
her fatigue was
"sleep well , `` he replied"
better to leave
his personal life was
"inside his council house , his advisors were"
but as soon as he walked
"the more serious the expression , the graver the issues he was"
"right now , with the thought of losing"
you always give
"and in a way , he had"
"sure enough , sam was"
siri bit her lip as malik got
they both cried
"in response , the guard bowed"
what business was
the boys both looked
when both of them were
my father was
i only wanted
especially in the business you  are
my ex-wife and i both worked hard over the years to make
only you are
"hell , `` he cursed"
his aide had
she  would obviously received
your combat skills are
and samuel was
"chapter 1 `` dad , i just do"
her father gently interrupted
"rachel bit her lip , wondering"
john stuart said
she slowly let
he softly interrupted
his relieved laughter flowed
his macaroni and cheese was
she usually timed
her father stepped
when the tall man emerged
her father shuffled
and he disappeared
"and shockingly , he had"
"his broad , muscular shoulders tapered"
i guess it has
he  would suspected
but the woman standing
ever since she  would turned
each visit had
that and the way she  would looked
but how could he have
rais and john discussed
the tiny table barely had
you two go
"if not , you know"
"rais , how about if you take"
outfits that did
she  would always admired
"unfortunately , nothing came"
as the night air closed
but this one came
as the horses approached
and i used
her father asked
her dad laughed
"sure enough , sitting"
a subject she definitely did
"with his last comment , she narrowed"
the two of you used
and here he was
his smile soothed
education levels increased
"unfortunately , no matter how tired she was"
and for being
she  would dated
as an even planner it was
"in other words , he was"
"with a groan , he kissed"
the dream was
but his hand was
"in the kitchen , he braced"
and what made
no man was
"this morning , it seemed"
so go pull on riding
but before she could go
he  would always acted
"his eyes lit on her shirt , enjoying"
no one ever dared
"with a snap of his fingers , he could have"
when he walked
the horses were
at the first sight of rachel and rais coming
"with that , she laughed"
the path had
when she refused
naked and calling
"but secondly , you do"
she abruptly turned
but the words were
the ones you used
"thankfully , sanity prevailed"
"with a last glance , she turned"
"with a self-satisfied grin , he reached"
"rachel rode right back to the stables , wanting"
"first of all , she had"
"instead , she said"
things he was
"thankfully , he missed"
"well , three if she were"
"on the opposite side of the corral , she watched"
the horse seemed
the corral was
her face paled
the excitement of a moment ago was
nothing like this had
irritation with you is
he instantly agreed
"for the next hour , they discussed"
"his deep , lustrous voice laughed"
her free hand reached
when his lips touched
the autumn air was
"with each button , the process reoccurred"
"unfortunately , the raw surge of energy that spiked"
maybe if she just pushed
but when he shifted
"this time though , it did"
chapter 3 rachel sighed
everyone in town was
the lobby area was
because fall was
"okay , she acknowledged"
"the phone by her elbow rang , startling"
thank you for being
the whole floor was
the cushioned chairs were
all the desks at this end of the hallway were
the others are
her hand fluttered
distance simply was
surely someone with more events under their belt should be
"in fact , you  are"
this list did
and her first comment would be
derrick simply waved
any way you might be
for as long as rachel could remember
i  will go
"a moment later , lucy transferred"
so what wines are
if things were
"with that , he disconnected"
"a moment later , derrick was"
"normally , mondays were"
as rachel walked
others in the offices looked
"all this time , rachel had"
her whole body language changed
the ice princess sleeping
"or lack of it , she clarified"
they all discussed
she would bill the man for every hour that she worked
"unfortunately , as the hour approached"
this one looked
the helicopter lifted
she almost did
the main house was
when i have
that declaration infuriated
and what might have
her chin lifted
she  would also cried
she  would buried
almost all of the roses had
"bottle after bottle , they sipped"
the relaxed feeling shifted
"his handsome , firm mouth formed"
"all the while , his hand on her thigh was"
"very soon , he was"
"but this time , there was"
something she was
"for that matter , no woman had"
he generally took
or that was
"a few moments later , he came"
"call , `` she whispered"
chapter 4 rachel surveyed
the satin shimmered
the edge of the material was
if one were
"oh , it was"
the teal fabric shimmered
"okay , and it did"
every nerve ending
one of the men bowed
the first man bowed
the men did
her shoulders slumped
the two guards looked
"with that , she snapped"
kadar and joe were
the man immediately pulled
by the time the elevator reached
"a moment later , her phone started"
"with another laugh , she pressed"
"besides , it could be"
"with a groan of irritation , and no small amount of trepidation , she once again pulled"
but in less than twenty minutes she would be
"with wobbly knees , she stepped"
"after two hours , she was"
her bolero jacket was
but his guests would be
he then smoothed
one eyebrow went
"with that , he straightened"
but as soon as their numbers started
but everything was
"thankfully , he dropped"
his voice commanded
not that she even owed
her eyes sliced
"by the end of his statement , he was"
one side of his mouth tilted
those words startled
her shivering increased
"again , another giggle slipped"
when both of his hands were
she even tilted
the thought occurred
"at that moment , he covered"
the fear did
her arms came
his hands slowly opened
her hips actually pushed
everything until now had
"rachel bit her lip , unaware that her fingernails were"
"but slowly , the pain dissipated"
a warmth filled
several more gentle movements and she closed
her mindless pleasure pulled
immediately he lifted
somehow that made
but the weekend turned
that probably was
but she pushed
the week was
when she reached
both boxes were
"linda , one of the other junior coordinators that rachel occasionally had"
linda only nodded
the akris gown was
rachel almost dropped
that hurt and she squeezed
but if you have
that comment caused
especially the women she  would seen
what just happened
"but next weekend , we do"
we  will add
"a moment later , she received"
"so in effect , you  are"
this one is
after several moments of silence he asked
they  would known
the flowers should already be
"thankfully , some of the vendors had"
"in fact , there were"
she actually spotted
she  would visited
"by thursday evening , she was"
a deep voice asked
adrenaline and no food were
and how did
now that the scare was
"they all understood , `` he explained"
not that he was
chapter 6 `` i have
he really should be
"in the end , he realized"
"along the way , he touched"
"with a deft move , he lifted"
he slowly lowered
as he increased
when she splintered
playful rais was
before he responded
that answer caused
his hands might not be
she only got
but with rais looking
the whole 'love ' and 'end of relationship ' issues were
if it gives
you will eventually be
my boss is
the man looked
the guard waited
"a moment later , he had"
the apartments were
the two men she  would seen
the two men looked
those men were
his apology went
chapter 7 rachel walked
a silly love song was
they  would been
his body actually hardened
damn he wanted
then he noticed
the first moment she  would spotted
his voice spurred
"her long , dark hair was"
that just made
she  would believed
she  would stupidly translated
"somehow , with everything that had"
"inside , she ordered"
"deep down , she guessed"
the tea was
"with a sob , she realized"
he  would hijacked
"for the past several weeks , her whole life had"
he  would even be
"within moments , her credit card had"
"inside the room , she did"
she simply curled
when the sun rose
she still did
no wonder she had
she almost started
but no one was
his fingers closed
he might not have
his phone rang and he glanced
his head of security had
"within minutes , he was"
"twenty minutes later , he was"
the building manager had
rais barely acknowledged
"at her door , he pounded"
if you  would waited
the surprise in his eyes and the smile that slowly grew
the grin on his face increased
rachel instantly noticed
"from now on , he was"
those simple words stilled
but you were
when you turned
what i was
but none of them measured
"with that nod , all of the tension from the past few days disappeared"
chapter 1 there was
"mentally , she sighed"
she  would worked
the minimum age was
ella now took
"thankfully , she counted"
the next guest moved
that strange sensation returned
this job might not be
if rude people or miserable weather was
and then they  would just as suddenly stopped
goodness he was
those dark eyes and his tanned skin made
her heartbeat increased
dominic carson and angelo donati had
her hungry eyes followed
personal conversations with the hotel guests were
those three boys had
"good grief , those three seemed"
"first , zayn had"
then dominic and angelo had
"okay , so the three of them had"
"in fact , that whole group stopped"
something in her stomach started
if her eyes glanced
her shift on the front desk finally ended
needless to say
ella definitely wanted
"the tall , incredibly handsome man who had"
zayn definitely was
the team thatnormally cleaned
and those darn flutterings were
"maybe the best friend of a distant cousin , she corrected"
she definitely was
she  would filled
her high cheekbones and those striking
her life was
this meeting with ella definitely was
obviously he was
maybe they could get
the way he was
"despite her completely inappropriate and unprofessional fascination with the man , she did"
her shyness appealed
the waiter immediately moved
"at her hesitation , he asked"
the coffee here is
his advisors were
their dynastic thinking was
why would a man like zayn come
he obviously worked
someone from the staff might have
the alcohol might not be
so dennis had
dennis would take
"goodness , he looked"
"but his dark suit and snowy , white shirt definitely were"
dennis never hesitated
ella might be
but his tastes had
every time he  would tried
for a man who prided
and he  would worked
"no , there was"
"thankfully , they were"
and what happened
"in fact , that might be"
when his eyes took
she  would taken
not with her but with fate and the system that did
she quickly changed
when someone called
"in that moment , he wanted"
"with her sneakers on , the top of her head did"
"in fact , that pantry was"
but he followed
johnny just made
"but on a monday , it was"
"even so , she shivered"
zayn almost laughed
those jeans were
everything about ella screamed
her nails were
"focus on something else , he ordered"
especially when she kissed
she  would expected
but he gained
his control could only take
and then realization of what had
you can go
no reason to let
so what if his order coincided
"chapter 2 the following night , ella smoothed"
"at least , the old zayn would have"
"when the doorbell rang , she glanced"
the trembling started
pretend like nothing happened
the best she could say
"no , she was"
and what there was
i just happened
zayn understood exactly what she was
"as a young girl , she  would practically danced"
the concierge at our hotel books tables there but he only gives
but la tesata is
except for a strikingly beautiful woman like ella who was
his eyebrows slashed
a huge fuss was
the view was
she  would never tasted
when the entire plate of pasta was
now you  are
the waiter bowed
the customers are
people the world over did
or who would run
"angelo , dominic and i would know"
"one time , he just needed"
and everyone turned
so he could get
mr. miller helped
just guys on the street trying
we only did
or who we could give
if you could do
"ella bit her lower lip , her eyes glancing"
although i do
a girl has
mine just happen
his appetites were
when they approached
the electric shock that rippled
her body remembered
he gently nudged
he could no more stop himself from kissing
"yes , they were"
when his fingers discovered
with that statement hanging
"with her against the wall once more , he shifted"
her gasps of surprise and excitement were
his large hand was
"please , `` she begged"
"with a flick of a tie and one button , the whole thing just slipped"
but then his eyes focused
then he kissed
then his strong arms lifted
but when his mouth moved
ella should have
when zayn wanted
and when it was
"in response , he pulled"
and the moment he kissed
ella eagerly pressed
ella completely agreed
but he only allowed
"with a swift move , she leaned"
when her hand once again followed
"with a gentle thrust , he pushed"
that horrible ache was
her tiny body was
over and over again his body moved
"initially fast , erratic and then slower and slower until finally , her breathing was"
that might have
and the whole process started
the sun was
his nasally voice called
"with a sigh of resignation , she followed"
but a lecture about something was
that look caused
nothing good could happen
i certainly did
the picture had
the rules were
her priority was
"in rush hour , the buses came"
when it finally arrived
her rent was
since ella had
three noise complaints and you  are
ms. z waved
with all the money you made
ms. z turned
"the mean , nosy woman had"
the real problem came
"no , the problem was"
and ella was
ms. conner was
the chief looked
"in the past , men had"
"literally , their heads rolled"
her landlady had
her employer had
"again , the chief shuffled"
the chief took
the chief agonized
"in the end , there was"
the result was
no one will give
and it eased
the view in front of him was
the message was
the little guy had
the problem with disciplining
"besides , she just loved"
even james had
"only two , frantic , passion filled"
so passion was
his adorable smile and mischievous ways helped
every time he came
he  would had
so many times over the past six years he  would turned
the fury that pounded
the only other feeling he could say
and anytime he  would touched
"more importantly , gone"
the idea of another man touching
"the first time , she  would gone"
the second time had
the last time he  would come
her silk shirt was
she quickly buttoned
his adopted country had
but nor would he allow
he  would simply ignored
"with a sigh , he walked"
amid the applause and the standing
but by the time the dinner was
the thought of spanking
but then he dismissed
so deep he had
this time would be
that one kiss in the hallway proved
chapter 7 ella paced
the cramped space made
"when in reality , he was"
some of her temper suddenly dissipated
and they had
things would be
she  would already started
but at least it was
the knock on the door startled
maybe you could leave
but then she realized
and where i was
especially if you  are
"good grief , she had"
this conference did
what would he do
his own father and not james who was
because you have
and i would know
"not really , `` he said"
that suggestion startled
her chin jutted
when their bodies were
the thought of someone here trying
"a tiny , angry voice said"
the little tyke growled
ella finally pushed
when ella stepped
a tear trickled
his harsh tone released
not even a congratulatory cup of coffee to see
apparently a photographer recognized
and you have
but it also gave
"and for the past hour , he  would been"
his smile disappeared
"in fact , if things went"
the bulky men that were
the men responded
several of the other men snapped
"unfortunately , he did"
"ella froze , astonished"
"come with me , `` he said"
only sixty minutes and her whole world had
chapter 8 ella stretched
the smell of fresh coffee was
and who was
slowly she opened
she should get
the details of the previous night were
although he suspected
or that one night they  would shared
his hand wanted
"unfortunately , having"
"well , what little had"
an announcement had
the details had
at least he will be
"besides , he  would see"
and even he had
when she emerged
she actually resented
his tiny body stretched
and things are
the kid was
your father is
"and yesterday , he came"
so max was
jane and marie were
no matter how much money zayn might have
other fathers did
no matter how hard it had
or maybe the first time he  would fallen
the man instantly snapped
zayn could see
zayn almost rolled
"with great care , he lowered"
could you actually leave
the realization that she was
"as my wife , you have"
the time when it counted
but you still disappeared
"no , `` he raised"
but that does
but he acknowledged
"even before that , he  would disappeared"
he never had
"unfortunately , neither was"
"and cheap , she reminded"
the jeans she was
zayn only pointed
the sparks were
"damn , why had"
ella heard the huskiness in his voice and wondered
the one who made
his hair had
his son was
as the entourage surrounded
then the limousine pulled
that street was
but nothing could have
when they landed
when one was
"but by that point , it was"
"suddenly , the amazing quarters made"
"the rest of ... everything , `` she stammered"
the things we discussed
"and most of the time , you were"
but his mind was
the first morning had
she  would savored
"that first morning , she  would relished"
"but by the second morning , the coffee had"
"in a word , it had"
she  would dressed
"the first few days , she  would been"
but apparently word got
now the entire palace staff was
a cook had
she  would simply turned
and she missed
"besides , he absolutely worshiped"
the pony was
the only reason she ventured
"okay , so she admitted"
even her arabic tutor was
"the first few mornings , the woman had"
but the woman must have
their meetings came
"in the end , ella had"
"for hours each day , she worked"
she would then practice with max during his afternoon tea time when the two of them had
"unfortunately , it seemed"
as long as she could see
this conversation would probably go
"every night , he  would come"
his hot eyes captured
her mind might still be
"tonight , she did"
instead of sitting
afraid of being
the ends of his tuxedo tie were
i only have
his grip slackened
his words only made
apparently i have
it just is
all she was
that something was
she  would lost
one leg rose
his fingers and hands were
"too frustrated , she pushed"
but then his hands moved
when his thumbs skimmed
what he was
when she hesitated
"this time , zayn let her have"
"a pair of strong arms , a kind word and she was"
the primary one was
this standoff between herself and the servants was
the coffee finished
those people all looked
this coffee might go
to the stable man who had
that horse is
and the realization made
it suddenly occurred
her friend had
she  would even lied
she somehow figured
because they know
and they  would made
he  would just noticed
her eyes traveled
"and i mean , if i get"
each and every one of you will be
every single person nodded
"with a sigh of relief , she looked"
"as a group , every person bowed"
because i  will never let
the three of them walked
"yes , life would be"
if her father were
"but since his death five years ago , electra has"
any advice would be
"dharran rashid abbas , sheik of sandura asked"
the girl you have
the bullet was
no expression came
the king smiled
"without the sacrifice of her father , you would have"
the king took
they can `` t be
they will give
the king `` s eyes shut and dharr froze in his seat until he noticed
the aide quickly took
the caffeine immediately went
the stress of preparing
he `` d stolen
as if the guards could take
"eight years ago , the men had"
the man standing
all the others in the room were
electra `` s jaw immediately dropped
the guard at the bottom of the stairs looked
"from yourself if necessary , `` he clarified"
her tone was
her fists balled
his silence only infuriated
"usually , she was"
people `` s guard comes
i `` ll be
her hands dropped
her best friend cleared
that only roused
the other boys and two other girls laughed
i `` ll get
"out in the cool , autumn evening , she looked"
"unfortunately , luck was"
the officer said
"fifteen minutes later , the officer came"
"a moment later , micka was"
"first the lost kiss , the not-lost ticket , the shoving"
he simply waited
the battle of wills was
but she `` d never liked
she `` d just wanted
and now that she was
every employer would be
"i `` m over here , `` susan reyes called"
susan `` s eyes closed
her friend `` s eyes shuttered
her comment only made
electra `` s eyes widened
but her guard would never allow
i `` d do
"about eight years ago , i almost had"
"ever since then , no man has"
look at how many relationships our friends have
susan didn `` t need to be
i `` ve been
this meeting today was
none of them doing
chapter 2 king abbas walked
her soft curves were
"her long , black hair cascaded"
"within the space of a few moments , dharr determined"
it never occurred
the idea passed
this adonis was
all of the men she `` d casually been
"no one , `` she said"
perhaps you have
"nothing like that , `` she said"
instead of answering
her anglican upbringing would be
"inwardly , he was"
electra didn `` t contradict him and ignored
"after more than twelve years , she still missed"
her monthly allowance was
"somehow , the idea that she wanted"
monetary rewards are
the idea was
women never turned
"i `` m passionate , `` she said"
instead of stating
greek history is
when a gray suited
her appointment with her guardian had
how long would it be
"but his warm , strong fingers wrapped"
the rest of the world receded
her hand tingled
maybe they were
"usually , this was"
"i `` m sorry , `` she said"
her first name is
the man nodded
his employer was
but his aide was
"no , he changed"
she would probably consider
dharr didn `` t care what was
"yes , the more he considered"
chapter 3 electra dialed
when there was
when would be
the man `` s schedule was
"please , just give"
something that shouted
she almost smiled
"the strapless green cocktail dress fit straight across her breasts with a pretty silver , beaded"
the rest of the dress hugged
the look suggested
the dress required
if he wanted
the indecision was
she could do
"as electra drove the car home , she reflected"
cubic zirconium were
maybe the wealth of the building or perhaps it was
"whatever the reason , she was"
a shiver of anticipation traveled
the elevator was
"at least , it never has"
electra neededto take
"breathing in a deep , shuddering"
the sweet desire coursed
thanks for breaking
just someone i was
this woman was
until he did
even her kiss was
"women , after the first encounter , turned"
"but then again , she might have"
i `` ve seen
i `` m not very good at keeping
the perfect shape of the petals that are
each bloom has
"it `` s amazing , `` she said"
"at her answer , he grinned"
her mouth dried
i `` m afraid i `` m not going
instead of standing
one of his aides was
a conglomerate is
"too many times , he `` d been"
why he cared
once he `` d worked
the martini was
"at some point , music had"
when his hands tangled
her body melted
when he lifted
the room he carried
she then struggled
"finally , he delicately pulled"
she just moved
"no , her mind could never have"
one finger accidentally brushed
when her fingers lingered
his own were
that kind of power only heightened
his mouth descended
as soon as her body subsided
when the second wave finally subsided
his laughter was
the sound forced
her breathing increased and her eyes closed
but the tear that touched
he `` d foolishly taken
as her breathing and heart rate slowed
"surely after that kind of experience , the world had"
her rebellious nature reasserting
instead of talking
no matter how she moved
"in the end , the passion was"
"this time , he rolled"
one hand was
"instantly , his arm came"
his deep sigh shattered
her fingers gently touched
electra `` s mind scrambled
since her curiosity had
once the climax for both of them had
"once there , he tossed"
"with a simple press of a button , the lights flicked"
but nothing came
everywhere he `` d touched
the audacity of a mere woman denying
most men shivered
didn `` t she know
he `` d also have
"in the meantime , he mentally made"
chapter 4 electra moved
when her memory of the night before returned
"besides , what was"
"within fifteen minutes of waking , she was"
"somehow , her car was"
"instead , she relived"
the only thing that could make
she `` d settle for tonight and be
she almost considered
thankfully the door to her bedroom was
the thought made
"as usual , when someone demanded"
"then with a flick of her wrist , she snapped"
the smile that crossed
chapter 5 glaring at the inanimate objectshe `` d just tossed
what right did
she `` d thought she `` d been
"this way , everyone came"
"unfortunately , she `` d never been"
the memories of their night started
but as she remembered
she `` d only known
the pay is
a job where the interviewer wouldn `` t be
her friend laughed
the next four days were
or even to give
and when she dreamed
when school let
gerrard `` s throat made
gerrard `` s palm slapped
the man just simply didn `` t know
his next words erased
"perhaps you `` ve heard of it , `` he teased"
boy the man had
all thoughts of making
the ripple of laughter made
i `` m not going
"but ellie , we `` ll have"
"without another word , the phone went"
don `` t let
"and even worse memories , `` she chided"
electra `` s hand dropped
"later that evening , she walked"
when he led
the man stiffened
all thoughts and suppositions about the beautiful apartment were
"at the first sight of him , her breath caught in her throat and she stopped"
when he entered
i `` ll see
chapter 6 saturday morning dawned
"well , she corrected"
but now the morning sunlight was
even though he `` d seen
i `` ve never been
the flare of triumph that came
just as he promised
"once in the champs elysee , she started"
"with another deep breath , she plunged"
"halfway up , she stopped"
and when dharr `` s arms wrapped
"electra didn `` t mind at all except for the fact that , when he was"
"between the kiss in the champs elysee and the chocolate crepe , she was"
dharr when through the store with an assistant and pointed
when the items were
"back at the apartment , the chauffer carried"
the set of black lace suspended
the bra barely covered
this one at least had
electra `` s head fell
"all over , wildfire burned"
"that night , sitting"
her whole world had
chapter 7 monday dawned
"for the next five days , she worked"
he never revealed
the term `` appealing
electra `` s mood immediately dropped
i like working
her self-respect was
the thought of dharr holding
the water revived
but the moment she stepped
she `` d lived
"all thoughts of other women , of leaving"
he `` d always considered
this woman snuggling
he `` d learned
"his body language , his expressions , his mannerisms all oriented"
"sure enough , her full , heavy breasts were"
especially since most of his concentration was
her heat welcomed
"despite her better judgment , she complied"
"in the end , when the climaxed finally took"
her voice screamed
she `` d missed
"i `` m very hungry , `` she answered"
she `` d covered
all of her clothes had
her self-introspection was
it `` s one of my favorite meals whenever i go
and the wait was
chapter 8 `` do
the month had
she `` d never traveled
she `` d definitely dented
"in fact , money was"
"private museum tours , operas , ballets , dinners at exclusive restaurants , touring"
his words chilled
her grandmother would be
"i `` ll visit you as often as i can but while i `` m not here , you `` ll have"
their time together was
controversial subjects were
but think of all the nights we `` d have
his offer had
what `` s wrong with making
she quickly shied
how long was
"i `` m just your next mistress , `` she said"
"in response , she walked"
"what relationship , she asked"
but the past few days had
her bag was
her mind stopped
dharr `` s body reacted
"but only during special moments , he reminded"
and now things were
her smile should have
i `` m usually finished
i `` m sure that we can find
but she raised
the expressions that crossed
her words only made
so i `` m assuming
"i mean , really , it is"
"not a very equal relationship , is"
but that only showed
but he considered
chapter 9 electra glanced
"on her grandmother , it usually portended"
the tall man had
a search for the mystery woman ongoing
she `` d been
how in the world had
"no , horrified"
some of these pictures were
he `` d lied
but no matter how hard she focused
a tear slipped
the article had
and some of the kids might get
her mind worked
his main goal was
electra sniffed and tried
"unfortunately , nothing really made"
i `` m trying
electra understood and walked
"as soon as they `` d burst through a side door , the photographers were"
the only good part was
the photographers spotted
"very efficiently , the guards dharr had"
her mind raced
but nothing he `` d said
gerrard `` s eyes clouded
electra `` s heart contracted
none of it was
in a more gentle tone he said
all those things were
when the elevator opened
i `` m not exactly sure why since i believe
perhaps you could enlighten
his conscience had
this beauty was
and she `` d just inadvertently handed
all i wanted
probably a lot more insecurities though since i never was
her han ds balled
but you always had
i never went
"in fact , i made"
the only thing i am
we `` ll leave
"electra sat in her seat next to her grandmother , discussing"
i hate to be
"in fact , they were"
"even now , the memory of how her friends had"
all your friends were
not one of your class mates could have
her grandmother nodded
"grandmother , did"
why couldn `` t i have
a lump formed
what a pair we are
so how do
the questions generally come
electra could see
"eventually , she fell"
the chair had
trust dharr to have
the plane had
the other occupants of the plane were
"in response , he took"
the shops were
the place was
the announcement of our engagement has
"of all the romantic marriage proposals , that had"
since no question has
his black eyes immediately hardened
"arm in arm , she walked"
all those feelings she `` d been
he `` ll make
"ms. knight , if you `` ll follow"
the windows were
your luggage has
"angry at the man `` s presumpt ion , she stomped"
when the line was
"seconds later , a knock sounded"
his eyes turned
would you follow
i `` m pretty sure i can make
he simply used
electra `` s last thought before she tumbled
each time dharr touched
last night was
"dharr didn `` t love her , he only wanted"
"well , not all her life , she corrected"
"on that point , her grandmother was"
the group of ten women simply stared
"finally , the woman in the back of the room holding"
"obviously , a future queen going"
the woman who appeared
a guard was
"after several comments , the vendor blushed"
if that something is
her explanation seemed
many people were
one or several of them had
she `` d never be
her appearance was
one of them was
the look lasted
she `` d have
the tension would make
"then on her knees , she crawled"
"but moments later , he gave"
the keys were
"amazingly , all was"
by the time night fell
"by midnight , after twelve hours of driving , she made"
"in great britain , the borders were"
"if the car didn `` t arrive at the guard station , they would come"
"still , nothing happened"
"airport , security , finding"
her mind absently noted
"thankfully , the key was"
"instead , she kicked"
the body guards and lack of normalcy had
no matter how much she loved
the dark circles under her eyes were
her skin was
could someone possibly know
not many people wanted
the day turned
then she `` d take
when that list was
the last one was
her fingers twitched
chapter 11 dharr prowled
"but in this case , the goal was"
when her guards had
the worry that had
"of course , he `` d postponed"
edna knight asked
dharr `` s angry eyes looked
and not being
how much time does
his eyes burned
the only reasons she would be
she only waited
"at least no political worries , he clarified"
h er hands were
but he simply raised
"for the first time , his firm mouth eased"
she `` d made
"at the bottom of the long list , she `` d written"
her eyes clouded
want to know
you `` ll have
especially the part about me loving
chapter 1 dana stared
even the normal low hum off office noises faded
"because of the previous year , being"
"unfortunately , the chief of staff was"
the role comes
her head was
but he has
"her mind swam with the various possibilities or arguments against this promotion , anything that would get"
"and of course , she followed"
one simply did
since the office was
perhaps they all just competed
possibly even social events that would be
"no , she  would just have"
some of the ideas were
"no , that one would have"
beautiful women were
omar must be
the top of her head barely reached
"as his intelligent , grey eyes looked"
"first things first , she reminded"
the opposite approach to this interview certainly had
"but with her comment , he was"
even my curtsy is
the things you do
the work you do
that last comment was
lunch time came
by nine of the clock that night she finished
he slowly walked
"a moment later , he instructed"
"when her phone rang again , she glanced"
"another blush , she really wished"
but this man made
"definitely not , `` she replied"
chapter 2 her cell phone rang once again and this time she was
instead of checking
"today , he stopped"
"except in battle , he  would never seen"
"this woman , with all of her feminist logic and soft heart , had"
he  would never dared
his body did
when her shaking settled
"otherwise , she was"
and her feelings for her boss were
"okay , they were"
the man worked
and that sound had
her heart raced
could someone just keep
no one knew where she was
and every muscle in her body ached
or at least pushing
her instructor had
"two years ago , she never would have"
early meant she was
and he  would argued
"but tonight , she was"
the dichotomy of being
the market might not have
"again , there was"
both men roared
so dana spun around and kicked
"and then , without compassion , she kicked"
the big man doubled
"as missiles , they were"
"as distractions , they were"
with his bleeding nose still gushing
with both men doubled
as she parked
even if that comment was
even though she did
he already had
"at least this way , she  would have"
however much she loved
the assistant looked
and the guns she  would seen
the men who had
-- - hassan looked
his dana was
two men were
the two we currently have
regardless of how much his body wanted
"his sweet , gentle dana , the woman who had"
his chest swelled
not only was
any luck on tracking
"as yet , we do"
if i find
her hand automatically went
she nervously looked
"regardless , it was"
while other kids are
but he refused
"right , dicing"
off in college and having
"in others , it had"
"relax , `` he said"
with that thought came
"good grief , even if she was"
the idea just seemed
her own bed would be
hassan instantly pictured
just relax and get
"chapter 3 the following day , things were"
"by the end of the day , she was"
surely those guys had
that just did
she also doubted
"after the battle in the marketplace yesterday , you  are"
the marketplace was
the brawl in the marketplace had
his eyes accidentally glanced
"hell , he  would wanted"
over and over again as he made
only two thugs reached
her comment infuriated
"okay , come"
"in fact , she did"
just the idea of putting
and the thought of her beautiful skin being
and ridiculous is
the only way you  are
"with a quick flick of his wrist , he  would flipped"
"unfortunately , her plan backfired"
he  would anticipated
admit that you  are
"her legs , which were"
he tentatively touched
when her tongue tentatively touched
her fingers against his skin were
he almost lost
when his thumb flicked
but then his hands and mouth were
his mouth traveled
when he smelled
"long minutes later , she opened"
instead of worrying
as his body slowly entered
"back in again just a bit deeper , measuring"
"this slender , incredibly passionate woman was"
"first of all , i know"
by the time i  would recovered
one he would eventually get
then the night slowly came
"the passion and crazy need for hassan , that even now came"
that should get
"carefully , she lifted"
they would know
"unfortunately , now was"
she quietly made
but they all looked
the streets were
she never got
the cab driver looked
his eyes frantically scanning
the officer approaching
dana heard another accident a couple of blocks away but the officers near her did
"no , something definitely was"
the officer bowed
sheik faiser-al-takar himself is
the thought of hassan knowing
as it was
the police officer seemed
"well , this was"
what if someone had
perhaps it had
that cab driver did
"whatever the reason , you will be"
the idea of her being
her mind whirled
besides the fact that she was
"or today , he corrected"
"and most of the time , they needed"
two nights will really be
but he  would goaded
and then he  would done
what would the guard do
lipstick and powder finished
how he managed
your speech for the conference this afternoon is
"hell , he even liked"
with all the people who bowed
a good spanking was
"by four of the clock that afternoon , dana was"
the poor man really had
a sandwich had
when she almost knocked
both men saluted
chapter 5 dana shuffled
"thankfully , the suit had"
not that she wanted
"just wait , `` the woman said"
"good grief , she practically announced"
"at six of the clock , hassan still had"
her two body guards were
which probably did
her reliable relaxation for anything that was
"no such luck , she realized"
and another matching
"in the kitchen , she approached"
a multi-layered cake with thick frosting and some gooey filling
maybe even decorations so that she  would have
"an hour later , she had"
four of them were
although if he came
the horrible woman had
dana actually missed
"way off base , but keep"
a timer went
but i can follow
how about if i give
but when has
all the food was
the fact that her throat was
"for the first time in her life , cooking had"
"sure enough , two men were"
both men straightened
it actually is
dana bit her lit and considered
at least for the time being
sumeet almost smiled
a few minutes later and known
the peace corps sounded
"unfortunately , the jungles of africa or south america might be"
he constantly demanded
he  would always preferred
"at which time , her traitorous body responded"
as she twirled
but as soon as she opened
"with a glance , he moved"
dana almost laughed
i just liked
if the dress was
"or out of a bed , `` he growled"
in a louder voice she called
if you  would taken
three sets of eyes widened
dana automatically turned
"with swift movements , he took"
the neckline had
"but no more , she mentally chided"
"right now , she needed"
"slowly , so she did"
until she straightened
"a very nice , very naked chest with that interesting"
"with one knee on the bed , he reached"
one moment he was
"with her hands against his shoulders , holding"
before he allowed
when the storm had
chapter 7 `` looking
especially since he was
so now there are
where could she possibly be
"unfortunately , the idea of hassan getting"
her frankness and openness were
the simple words were
occupational hazard i assume
"the other agents outside , keeping"
"the marshals , beth and joe , they tried"
the bad guy was
there would never be
the rest is
so if getting
what could he possibly have
how could a woman be
how about putting
he actually laughed
when it finally did
he bent and kissed
chapter 1 the twig breaking to her left instantly alerted
her ears were
this second sound changed
unfortunately the shadow was
whoever it was
her muscles tensed
every nerve in her body was
the man landed
"from the current distance , he was"
and it terrified
the voice said
i definitely remember
his size was
any closer and she would be
the man laughed
his white teeth again flashed
she could barely make
you could too easily be
"nothing really important , she reminded"
"suddenly , all the softness was"
"no one , not even rulers of countries , had"
"and yet , this tiny , beautiful woman with a figure made"
"instead , he pierced"
"one of very obvious importance , `` he pointed"
the idea of her disobedience was
she quickly backed
an idea formed
"two more steps , then she  would run"
as soon as the motor roared
his body guards were
she only took
"after a long moment , he walked"
"despite her fear of him , her body reacted"
her jealousy had
his eyes searched
the end was
"sarila shrunk back from his touch , wishing"
the ragged material of the chair was
if it happened
nothing in this room had
that pride was
kasar only smiled
but our parents are
"the doorbell rang at that moment , interrupting"
"without another word , she disappeared"
only an idiot would be
sarila only glared
a life growing
as soon as the limousine arrived
"kasar , these are"
sarila paid for her ticket and waited
latin dancing was
"for a few hours each week , she became"
the joy of dancing
"in fact , the song currently playing"
but she  would seen
the music reached
yet another skill that i do
"and no , dancing was"
by the time they all said
the smooth ride of the limousine combined
her actions contradicted
a man could only take
the back door of the limousine opened
another guard followed
echoed throughout the room as children rushed
each child took
once all fifteen five year olds were
